// ============================================================
// Hifzhelper — client-side position tracking (V3.12.0, rebuilt V3.14.0)
// Current as of V3.45.5
// The Worker's position.js only stores whatever JSON blob it's given (see
// that file's own comment) — all the actual progress logic lives here,
// same "computed client-side" design already documented in SCHEMA.md.
//
// V3.45.4: architectural rebuild of how the Sabaq frontier itself works,
// confirmed in chat after a real bug -- a Sabaq entry saved correctly but
// the separately-stored position.sabaqTo silently failed to advance
// alongside it (a savePosition() call swallowed by an empty catch),
// leaving prepopulation and Sabaq Dhor's "current" quarter both stuck on
// stale data with zero visible trace anything had gone wrong. sabaqTo/
// activeJuz are no longer stored at all -- computeActualSabaqFrontier
// (below) computes them FRESH every time, directly from real Sabaq
// history, so there's nothing left to silently desync from what actually
// happened. Confirmed explicitly: the default frontier is simply
// whichever Sabaq entry is most recently dated -- NOT an attempt to
// algorithmically determine which juz' is "further along" across a
// student's whole history. That was this rebuild's first draft and the
// user caught a real flaw in it: study order is only fixed through juz'
// 30 then 29 (backwards from surah 114, then forward from 29's start) --
// after that, students genuinely diverge (some continue backwards, some
// jump to juz' 1), "there isn't a system to code against" for that
// branching. Comparing across juz' with one hardcoded order would
// silently misjudge "further along" for any student whose real path
// doesn't match it. The simpler "most recent entry wins" rule sidesteps
// that entirely -- no cross-juz' comparison anywhere in this file
// anymore.
//
// V3.45.5: V3.45.4 also added position.sabaqDhorManualOverride, a
// persistent manual-position override for Sabaq Dhor -- REMOVED again
// here after further discussion. That field was never actually needed:
// Sabaq Dhor's manual-select field turned out to just be a 3rd input
// into the exact same composited from/to range its own "Confirm Sabaq
// Dhor" checkboxes already build for whichever single entry is being
// saved (compositeCheckedSabaqDhorRows, js/sabaqDhorPage.js) -- nothing
// about it needs to persist on `position` at all, let alone affect a
// future prepopulation the way this field would have.
//
// Everything below computeActualSabaqFrontier/advancePositionAfterSabaq
// -- computeLingeringRows, computeSabaqDhorRows, computeCurrentJuzRows,
// computeSabaqDhorSections, etc. -- is UNCHANGED from before this
// version. They still just read .sabaqTo/.activeJuz/.previousJuz off
// whatever position-shaped object they're given; what changed is only
// WHO constructs that object and HOW (js/sabaqPage.js and
// js/sabaqDhorPage.js now compute sabaqTo/activeJuz fresh before calling
// into any of this, rather than reading a stored value).

// when this save crosses into a NEW juz', the juz' just left behind
// becomes "lingering" in Sabaq Dhor (confirmed in chat) until it moves to

// V3.19.1: takes BOTH endpoints now, not just "to" -- determines the

// direction (compareVerseKey, shared/data.js), rather than assuming "to"
// always represents the newest point reached. A bulk/historical catch-up
// entry can have its fields filled in ascending numeric order (lower as
// From, higher as To) rather than juz' 30's actual backward chronology,

// From=88:1/To=114:6 means surahs 89-114 are fully done and only ayah 1
// of surah 88 is done, so 88:1 (not 114:6) is where the next sabaq
// continues from. For every other (forward-studied) juz', the frontier
// is the numerically HIGHER endpoint instead. Found live (confirmed in
// chat) after V3.19.0 still got a bulk-entry student's frontier wrong.
// V3.45.4: substantially simplified -- no longer computes or stores
// sabaqTo/activeJuz at all (see file header), so the old "is this

// gone entirely, along with its SABAQ_STUDY_ORDER dependency. Takes

// Sabaq point, excluding today's brand-new portion — confirmed in chat,
// replacing the earlier "beginning of Quran / halfway point" rule
// entirely. Builds quarter by quarter as Sabaq progresses: the quarter
// Sabaq is currently IN (partial, up to the frontier) is section 1;
// each already-fully-memorised quarter before it is its own section too
// (at most 3, since a juz' has 4 quarters and the 4th-equivalent is
// always the one currently in progress). Returns [] if nothing's been
// sabaq'd yet in this juz' (nothing to revise).
// NOTE: still V3.13.0's model, reading position.activeJuz as before —
// Sabaq Dhor's own rebuild (rollable quarter/half/juz' sections,
// progressive Dhor-eligibility) is a separate, later phase; this function
// is untouched here so that still-live card keeps working against the
// same position shape in the meantime.
// 2026-08-06, confirmed in chat: exact structural mirror of
// computeSabaqDhorSections above, using structuralMaqraOf/
// structuralMaqraBounds/studyMaqraIndex (8 per Juz') instead of the
// quarter equivalents (4 per Juz'). Only meaningful when the Rub'/Hizb
// model is active (ref='uthmani') -- Maqra has no Waterval equivalent.
