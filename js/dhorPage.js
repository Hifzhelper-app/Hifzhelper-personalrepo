// ============================================================
// Hifzhelper — Dhor card (one of 4 in the unified day-log view, V3.6.1)
// Current as of V3.38
// Segment picker (quarter/half/full-juz', in whichever reference is
// active), the real timer/lap feature, tajweed tags, mistakes, comment.
//
// V3.10.0: the reference (waterval/uthmani) is no longer a local
// per-device dropdown on this page — it's derived from the student's
// own mushaf choice (Setup), fetched fresh on every open, same rule
// everywhere in the app: 13-line and Hybrid both resolve to waterval
// (quarter/half/juz' always follow 13-line rules for Hybrid, confirmed
// in chat), 15-line Madani resolves to uthmani.
//
// V3.9.0: plan-as-default is now wired in. On open, fetches today's Dhor
// plan(s) (produced by the rolling schedule configured in Setup, or
// created any other way — this page doesn't care which) via
// apiPlans.getForDate. Zero plans: falls back to the manual picker,
// unchanged. One plan: pre-fills every field from it and remembers its id
// so saving links back to it (apiDhor.save's existing plan_id handling —
// see linkPlanIfProvided in worker/src/logHelpers.js — already does the
// rest, unchanged). More than one: shows a plain selector instead of
// guessing which one the student means (per the "never auto-selected"
// rule already agreed for this feature) — picking one behaves exactly
// like the one-plan case; leaving none picked behaves like the zero-plan
// case.
//
// V3.23.0 (Dhor detail rebuild, Phase A -- an earlier, unrelated phase
// numbering than the "Phase A/B" below): the zero-plan-for-today case no
// longer just falls back to a blank manual picker. apiGetDhorDefaultEntry
// used to check, in order: a missed plan (backdated to ITS OWN date, a
// catch-up entry) → the closest future plan (today's date, borrowed
// early) → continuing from the last actual Dhor entry → the very first
// eligible segment. Superseded below.
//
// Pure queue model (2026-08-02, Phases A+B of a separate 4-phase rebuild):
// the model above was confirmed wrong -- `plans` isn't a calendar of
// dated commitments, it's a single ordered queue with no dates on
// anything not yet done, so "missed" and "future" never really existed
// as distinct concepts; they only looked like they did because rows used
// to be pre-generated with dates attached. Phase A
// (worker/src/dhorSchedule.js) collapsed computeDefaultDhorEntry to just
// today's plan (an explicit override, if one exists) or else always
// continuing from the last logged entry. Phase B (this file) matches
// that: the missed/future branches and the first_segment source are gone
// from here too, and a same-day batch of more than one plan no longer
// shows an inline "which one do you mean" picker (the "never
// auto-selected" rule from V3.9.0, above -- deliberately reversed) -- the
// first item in the batch is always what's pre-filled, and the rest
// stays reachable via Plan Dhor only.
//
// segmentsPerJuz/unitMarkerCount used to be defined locally here — moved
// to shared/data.js (V3.9.0) since the new server-side schedule generator
// (worker/src/dhorSchedule.js) needs the exact same math, and two copies
// of it is exactly what CONVENTIONS.md principle 2 exists to prevent.
// computeSegmentRange itself stays local: it indexes by raw MARKER
// position (this page's own position picker always lists every marker),
// which is a genuinely different calculation from shared/data.js's
// segmentRangeForUnitIndex (which indexes by unit-of-granularity
// instead) — not just a naming variant of the same thing.
//
// Has its own independent date selector (defaults to today on every open)
// — same reasoning as the other two log cards.
// ============================================================

// V3.21.2 fix: this MUST be declared before anything in this file (or in
// js/sabaqPage.js / js/sabaqDhorPage.js, which load after this one and
// assign into it too) can reference it. It was previously declared much
// further down, after line 237's `EDIT_HANDLERS.dhor = ...` had already
// tried to use it -- a `const` binding is unusable from the top of its
// scope until its own declaration line runs, so that threw
// ReferenceError: Cannot access 'EDIT_HANDLERS' before initialization
// the instant the page loaded. That halted the rest of THIS script,
// which is why Save stopped working on Dhor (its click handler is wired
// up further down in this same file) -- and since the crash meant this
// const never actually ran, js/sabaqPage.js and js/sabaqDhorPage.js hit
// the exact same error on their own EDIT_HANDLERS.sabaq/sabaqDhor lines,
// which is why Save broke on those two cards as well, and why History
// never appeared anywhere (renderRecentEntries, defined further down in
// this file, was never successfully reachable either).
const EDIT_HANDLERS = {}; // populated by each card's own file: EDIT_HANDLERS.sabaq = loadSabaqEntryForEdit, etc.
