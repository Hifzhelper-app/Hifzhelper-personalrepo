## V3.48.0 — Surahs in my Heart: Eraser (2026-08-11)

**Files touched:** `index.html`, `js/sihScreen.js`, `css/sih.css`, `js/icons.js`, `js/sw.js`, `TODO.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.

A third mode next to Solid and Gradient: Eraser. With it active, tapping a coloured surah clears that one region back to white — tapping an already-clear one does nothing. It's a genuine undo-stack citizen rather than a shortcut: erasing pushes one more action onto the same history as a fill, so pressing Undo right after an erase brings the region's previous colour straight back, solid or gradient alike. The colour wheel, lightness slider, and swatches have nothing to offer in this mode, so they step aside for a short "Tap a coloured surah to clear it" hint, and the toolbar's colour indicator swaps to an eraser glyph so it's clear at a glance which mode is active. The surah-name chip still appears on every erase, now with " — cleared" appended.

Nothing about save, export, or the V3.46.0→V3.47.0 picture migration needed special-casing: an erased region is simply "this region's most recent action says no colour," which is exactly how an untouched region already worked, so those code paths carry it for free. The Node harness grew 15 checks against the real shipped engine — no-ops on already-white and already-erased regions, exactly one action per real erase, the chip wording, Undo restoring the precise prior colour, one region's erase never touching a sibling's fill, and the export path handling an erase cleanly — for 43/43 overall.

## V3.47.0 — Surahs in my Heart: vector-region engine, letter specks fixed at the root (2026-08-11)

**Files touched:** `index.html`, `js/sihScreen.js` (rewritten), `css/sih.css`, `assets/quran-heart-regions.json` (new), `assets/quran-heart-lines.svg` (new), `js/sw.js`, `TODO.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.

The white specks inside letter counters (the loops of ة، م، ص and so on staying white when their surah was coloured) are gone — not patched, but removed at the root by replacing the pixel flood-fill engine with a vector one ("Option C", chosen in chat over two alternatives after inspecting the master archive and the reference implementation). The scene is now three layers in one SVG: the optional background photo at the bottom; 115 closed region shapes in the middle (one per surah, Ash-Shu'ara in two parts) that are what actually get coloured and tapped; and the original artwork on top, untouched, with its names now sitting *above* the colour so their counters show the region colour through. Two behaviour upgrades came confirmed with the rewrite: tapping a printed surah name now fills its region (names are big natural tap targets), and a small chip appears after each fill naming the surah in Arabic and English, then fades — helpful when zoomed out. Taps landing exactly on boundary lines stay ignored as before, via the new text-free lines asset, which is precisely why the names themselves remain tappable. Zoom is now genuinely vector-crisp at every level: the SVG re-renders at its true size after each gesture instead of scaling a fixed-resolution bitmap.

The region shapes were not taken from the reference site — its tracing measurably wanders around the original lines — but traced from this artwork's own verified segmentation, in its own coordinate frame, dilated to tuck under the linework so adjacent shapes meet beneath the lines. Audited at export resolution with a real SVG rasterizer under the criterion users actually experience: every region 100% covered by its shape, zero foreign colour visible anywhere the artwork's ink doesn't cover, with one documented sub-perceptual anti-aliased pixel at the image's left edge where the artwork itself is clipped by the viewBox. Surah identities were transferred spatially from the reference data as a clean 115-for-115 match and independently confirmed by three glyph anchors (the ص of Sad, the طه of Ta-Ha, and the hyphen of "Al-Anfal"), full surah-number coverage, and a name cross-check against the app's own surah list — the chip uses the app's `surahName(n)` as the single source of truth.

Saved pictures are safe: the save format moves from tap coordinates to region keys, and any picture saved under V3.46.0 migrates silently on first load — the migration was tested against real old-format data, with every action landing on its independently-computed region. Export stays at 1191x1684 as confirmed. A Node harness ran the actual shipped engine against the actual shipped assets: 28/28 checks passed. No worker or migration changes; frontend-only deploy, no ordering constraints — note the two new files land in the existing `assets/` folder.

## V3.46.0 — "Surahs in my Heart": the colouring activity (2026-08-11)

**Files touched:** `index.html`, `js/sihScreen.js` (new), `css/sih.css` (new), `assets/quran-heart.svg` (new — **note: new `assets/` folder**), `js/icons.js`, `js/auth.js`, `js/app.js`, `js/sw.js`, `TODO.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.

A whole new screen: the user's uploaded anatomical-heart artwork, divided into all 114 labelled surah regions, coloured in by tapping — a relaxation/connection activity as surahs are memorised, deliberately connected to no progress tracking anywhere in the app. Solid fills and two-colour vertical gradients, chosen from a full free colour picker (hue/saturation wheel + lightness slider), with multi-step undo. Pinch/scroll zoom and pan with a Zoom-to-fit reset, since several regions are small. A background image can be added that sits only around the heart (the regions themselves stay opaque), changed or removed separately, and is never persisted. Explicit Save keeps one picture per user on the local device only (no backend involvement at all), restored on the next visit; Reset clears the colours while the last saved picture survives until the next Save — the confirmation says so. Save as PNG exports at the full fixed internal resolution, asking with-or-without background only when a background is actually loaded.

On large screens the heart takes up to 75% of the width with the controls fully expanded in a left-hand panel; on mobile the controls roll up — a slim always-visible toolbar (colour swatch, solid/gradient toggle, undo, zoom-to-fit, menu), with the colour picker and the picture actions each sliding up as a bottom sheet, dismissed by tapping the canvas or the sheet's chevron. New nav entry + Home tile ("Surahs in my Heart", a simple heart glyph in the existing icon style), with undo and zoom-to-fit icons added to the shared set alongside it.

Under the hood, since the artwork's 1,603 paths carry no per-region ids: the SVG is rasterized once at a fixed 1191x1684 internal resolution (the same on every device, so exports are always crisp), every open pixel is labelled into connected regions at load, and a tap paints its whole region into a fill layer, dilated a couple of pixels under the line art so anti-aliased edges never show a white halo. The exterior is the corner-connected region rather than anything touching the border — two real surah regions on the artwork's left edge are clipped by the viewBox and genuinely touch it. All of this was verified directly against the real artwork and the real shipped code (a Node harness ran `js/sihScreen.js` itself against the true rasterized pixels: 21/21 checks — no leaks between surahs, taps on line art / the exterior / text-glyph holes correctly ignored, undo and save/restore byte-identical round-trips), plus a visually inspected composed render. The only change to the artwork file itself is added `width`/`height` attributes on the SVG root, which Safari requires to size an SVG drawn onto a canvas.

## V3.45.15 — Genuinely-abortable duplicate confirmation, a real regression fixed, checkbox refined (2026-08-11)

**Files touched:** `worker/src/logHelpers.js`, `worker/src/sabaqLog.js`, `worker/src/dhorLog.js`, `worker/src/sabaqDhorLog.js`, `js/sabaqPage.js`, `js/sabaqDhorPage.js`, `js/dhorPage.js`, `css/detail-pages.css`, `index.html`, `js/sw.js`, `TODO.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.

Sabaq Dhor's manual field — the checkbox and its From/To ayahs — now correctly clears after a successful save. It was a real regression from V3.45.10: that version's state-preservation logic, built specifically to protect a student's in-progress manual entry across an incidental re-render like a rollup-toggle tap, had no way to tell that case apart from a save just having genuinely completed — so it was faithfully restoring the just-saved values right back onto what should have been a fresh screen. Fixed by explicitly clearing those 3 elements immediately before the post-save re-render runs, so the preservation logic finds nothing left to preserve.

The bigger piece: a duplicate-save confirmation across all 3 log cards that can genuinely be cancelled, not just a warning shown after the fact. The previous shape of duplicate detection always inserted the row regardless, only flagging it afterward — which meant there was never actually anything to abort, since the entry already existed by the time any response reached the browser. `insertLog` now takes a `force` parameter: when it finds a duplicate and isn't told to force through, it returns without touching the database at all. Each of the 3 save handlers checks for exactly that response, shows the specified native confirmation, and either re-sends the same payload with `force: true` or leaves the form untouched if the student cancels. Dhor's own handler needed particular care, since it has a pool-update step that follows the save and must not run until a save has actually happened.

A smaller, more mechanical piece: each of the 3 worker handlers now guards its plan-linking and attendance-marking steps on the insert having actually produced a row — both would otherwise fire against an entry that was never written, since the previous code assumed `insertLog` always returned one.

Verified directly rather than assumed correct: the `insertLog` change against a simulated database covering 5 scenarios (a first entry, a genuinely-blocked duplicate with nothing written, that same content forced through afterward, distinct content passing through unblocked, and the same content from a different student — since the duplicate scope is per-student). And Sabaq Dhor's checkbox gets one further pass on top of V3.45.14's own work — a touch smaller, with breathing room added on its left this time rather than its right.

---

## V3.45.14 — Bigger checkboxes on medium/large, manual field becomes a real From/To range (2026-08-11)

**Files touched:** `css/detail-pages.css`, `js/sabaqDhorPage.js`, `index.html`, `js/sw.js`, `TODO.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.

Two independent changes to Sabaq Dhor. The checkbox itself is genuinely bigger now on medium and large screens — `transform: scale(1.8)` on the native input, deliberately not its own width/height, since that specific approach was already found unreliable across browsers earlier in this app's own history. The requested space reduction came along with it: the container itself narrows, and the outer group's own right-edge padding trims down too, together covering both readings of "the space to the right of the checkbox" an annotated screenshot confirmed were meant together, not separately. Mobile is untouched throughout.

The bigger piece: "Set Sabaq Dhor" is no longer a single ayah — it's a real From/To range now, matching the exact shape Sabaq's own card already has. Rather than inventing a new pattern, the 3 functions driving this field were generalized to take the same `side` parameter Sabaq's own picker fields have used since early in this project. The one shared confirmation checkbox sits next to "To" specifically, with "From" getting the same empty placeholder the section rows already use when they have no Move-to-Dhor action of their own — so the grid's shared column structure holds without needing a special case. `compositeCheckedSabaqDhorRows` folds in a genuine 2-point range from this now, rather than the zero-length single-point range it used to build, falling back cleanly (not crashing) if only one side happens to be filled in when the box is checked.

The state-preservation mechanism this screen already depends on — reading the manual field's live values before every rebuild and writing them back after, since this grid's content gets rebuilt from scratch several times during ordinary use — was extended to carry both sides through together rather than just one point. Verified directly against the real function bodies before shipping: 7 checks on the actual generated markup, plus 5 scenarios run against the real composite-range logic itself.

## V3.45.13 — Sabaq Dhor large/mobile breakpoint refinement (2026-08-10)

**Files touched:** `css/detail-pages.css`, `js/sabaqDhorPage.js`, `index.html`, `js/sw.js`, `TODO.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.

Live checks of V3.45.12 confirmed the medium breakpoint already renders correctly, so this release deliberately leaves 768-1179px untouched and corrects only the 2 affected ranges.

At 1180px and above, the 44px fields were being centred inside grid tracks that had absorbed surplus vertical space, producing large blank areas above and below the first row. The Sabaq Dhor grid now takes its block height from its own content, sizes implicit rows to `max-content`, packs them at the start, and uses the same 4px vertical outer padding as its 4px row gap. This keeps the outer border while collapsing the 3 rows to their intended compact group.

Below 768px, the field column was losing width to an inactive roll-up wrapper and its flex gap, a 44px checkbox track, two 8px grid gaps, and 8px horizontal outer padding. `updateRollupStepperVisibility()` now marks the stepper `.rollup-inactive` when both directions are unavailable; mobile CSS removes only that inactive gutter. The mobile checkbox track becomes 32px wide while remaining 44px high, and the horizontal grid gaps and outer padding become 4px. Together those changes return enough width to the first field to avoid the reported wrap without moving its checkbox inside the field border or changing the medium layout. When a roll-up control is genuinely available, its wrapper remains present and functional.

All CSS/JS references and the inert `js/sw.js` asset list are synchronized at V3.45.13.

## V3.45.12 — Sabaq Dhor bordered rows and compact alignment (2026-08-10)

**Files touched:** `css/detail-pages.css`, `index.html`, `js/sw.js`, `TODO.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.

The single outer border introduced in V3.45.11 stays exactly where it is, continuing to group the complete "Confirm Sabaq Dhor" section. Inside that group, the 2 generated quarter fields and the manual surah:ayah picker each regain their own border. Their associated checkboxes remain outside those individual field borders, but inside the outer group border, in the existing fixed 44px checkbox column.

The alignment problem came from the 2 quarter fields being `<label>` elements: they inherited `.detail-page label`'s 16px top margin and 4px bottom margin, while the manual picker is a `<div>` and inherited neither. A scoped `#sabaqDhor_sections > .sabaq-dhor-row-text` rule now resets those margins to zero. All 3 grid rows therefore use only the shared 4px `row-gap`, while their fields and checkbox containers share the same 44px minimum height. The existing shared 3-column grid remains intact, so each checkbox continues moving with its associated field and all checkboxes stay on one vertical line. No JavaScript, save behaviour, or data handling changed.

The release references in `index.html` and the inert `js/sw.js` asset list are now synchronized at `3.45.12`. The uploaded source had `index.html` still at `3.45.10` while `js/sw.js` had already reached `3.45.11`; this release gives every CSS/JS URL one fresh version as required by the project's cache-busting convention.

## V3.45.11 — Sabaq Dhor's 3 rows consolidated into one visual group (2026-08-10)

**Files touched:** `css/detail-pages.css`, `js/sabaqDhorPage.js`, `js/sw.js`, `TODO.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.

V3.45.10 gave "Quarter 2," "Quarter 1," and "Set Sabaq Dhor" a genuinely shared grid, which fixed their width and left-alignment — but each row still drew its own separate border, and "Set Sabaq Dhor" still carried its own heading above it, both leftovers from when these were 2 separate layout contexts. This version finishes the consolidation: one border wraps all 3 rows as a single group instead of 3 separate boxes, and the second heading comes out entirely, since a single shared border already makes clear on its own that all 3 rows belong to "Confirm Sabaq Dhor."

The spacing fix worth calling out specifically, because it wasn't chased as its own separate change: the previously inconsistent gap before "Set Sabaq Dhor" turned out to be that heading's own inherited top margin, sitting on top of the grid's own row spacing. Once the heading itself was gone, every row transition was left with nothing but that same shared spacing value between it — which the user had already pointed to directly as the amount that looks right. The fix followed from removing the heading; it didn't need its own line of CSS.

One thing worth being precise about: the border removal on the manual field's own picker is scoped specifically to its position inside this grid (`#sabaqDhor_sections > .verse-ref-field`), not a change to `.verse-ref-field` itself, which Sabaq's own From/To fields also use and were never part of this — those keep their own individual border exactly as before.

---

## V3.45.10 — Sabaq Dhor's manual field becomes a genuine part of the shared grid (2026-08-10)

**Files touched:** `css/detail-pages.css`, `index.html`, `js/sabaqDhorPage.js`, `js/sw.js`, `TODO.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.

V3.45.9 tried to make "Set Sabaq Dhor" match "Quarter 2"/"Quarter 1" in height and width by matching values across what were still 2 separate layout contexts — and the height fix didn't actually hold up once live. This version takes the architectural fix instead, extending the same principle already proven for the 2 section rows in V3.21.2 (one shared grid, so every column genuinely lines up rather than approximately matching): "Set Sabaq Dhor" is now a genuine 4th part of that same `#sabaqDhor_sections` grid, not a separate row sitting below it.

The real complexity here wasn't the CSS — it was making sure this didn't quietly break something that already worked. That grid's entire content gets rebuilt from scratch 4 separate times during ordinary use (screen load, Move to Dhor, and both rollup-merge/split toggle taps), and moving the manual field inside it meant every one of those triggers would now also wipe out whatever a student had already typed there. The fix: read the manual field's live values immediately before the rebuild, then write them straight back onto the freshly-created elements right after — the exact same rebuild-then-rewire approach this function was already using successfully for the Move-to-Dhor buttons, just extended to one more element instead of invented from scratch. Verified directly against the real function body before shipping, not a reimplementation: 4 scenarios covering a first render, a value surviving one rebuild, a value surviving with its checkbox deliberately left unticked, and a value surviving 2 rebuilds in a row, plus 6 checks on the actual generated markup and operation ordering.

One thing worth being honest about going in: putting all 3 rows in one grid guarantees they share identical column widths, which is what actually fixes the left-alignment and width problems by construction. It does not automatically fix row heights — CSS grid rows still size independently of each other unless something explicitly ties them together, which is exactly why the previous `min-height: 44px` attempt didn't visibly resolve things. That same rule is kept here, now scoped to the field's new position inside the grid, with the underlying reasoning written out in the delivery notes — flagged for a live look given it's already fallen short once.

## V3.45.9 — Checkbox boxes hidden, timer icon repositioned, Sabaq Dhor boxes matched (2026-08-10)

**Files touched:** `css/detail-pages.css`, `index.html`, `js/sw.js`, `TODO.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.

3 refinements to what V3.45.6–V3.45.8 already shipped. The border and background around every checkbox come off entirely — confirmed 3 times over, with the clearest version distinguishing the checkbox's own native border (left completely alone) from the container wrapping it (`.checkbox-box`, the actual target). Its sizing and alignment role — the part that genuinely fixed the earlier cross-browser checkbox-sizing problem — is untouched; only the visible border and background go, and the background was already invisible either way since it matched the surrounding card's own color exactly.

The timer icon on Sabaq/Sabaq Dhor/Dhor's own header rows used to sit in a separate, fixed-width grid column — meaning it always started at roughly the same horizontal position regardless of how short the actual heading text was, creating a visible gap that made it look disconnected rather than reading as one phrase. A new `.card-header-title-group` groups the heading and the timer button into one flex unit instead, so the button's position now genuinely follows wherever the text ends.

Sabaq Dhor's 3 long boxes — the 2 "Confirm Sabaq Dhor" rows and the "Set Sabaq Dhor" picker — now match in both height and width. Height needed an explicit `min-height: 44px` on both (not a hard `height`, since the section rows' own text can wrap to 2 lines on narrower screens and a fixed height would have clipped it). Width needed something more deliberate: an invisible spacer added to the manual row, sharing `.move-to-dhor-btn`'s exact class and text rather than a guessed pixel value, so its width is guaranteed to match the other rows' own 2nd grid column — which, being one shared grid track across both "Confirm Sabaq Dhor" rows, takes up real space even on rows where it's empty.

---

## V3.45.8 — V3.45.7 follow-up: rail-grid fix, Stopwatch cleanup, timer labels, maximized sizing (2026-08-10)

**Files touched:** `css/detail-pages.css`, `index.html`, `js/dhorPage.js`, `js/logDetailScreen.js`, `js/sw.js`, `TODO.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.

A live screenshot of V3.45.7's actual result surfaced a real bug alongside 3 refinements. `.log-detail-rail`'s wide-screen grid rule had been left at `repeat(4, 1fr)` — a straightforward miss, not caught when Timer came out of the rail in the previous version. 3 real cards were being squeezed into quarter-width columns each, with the leftover 4th column explaining the large empty gap the screenshot showed. Now `repeat(3, 1fr)`, matching what's actually there.

Dhor's own pre-existing Stopwatch button — which predates V3.45.7's header-icon system entirely — comes out completely: the button, its column, its CSS, and every JS reference across 3 files. It had become straightforwardly redundant with the new header icon. One detail worth being precise about: the old button's target-minutes-per-juz' setup logic didn't just get deleted along with it — it moved into Dhor's own new header-icon handler, since Dhor remains the one card with a genuine target concept of its own that needs setting correctly before the timer opens. Duration itself stays exactly as it was, deliberately not expanded to fill the space — an earlier proposal to do that was explicitly withdrawn.

Every timer icon gets a "Timer" text label now, matching the same icon-on-top, uppercase-label convention the Save button already established — nothing invented, just extended to a new spot. And the maximized timer, which previously just filled the entire viewport unconditionally in both modes, gets a real size and position of its own: 60% of viewport height, centered both horizontally and vertically, width capped at the app's own standard 50%/30% breakpoints. This should also incidentally resolve an earlier report that the timer's own close icon wasn't responding while maximized — it was sitting right at the very top edge, overlapping the device's own status bar, a classic dead-zone scenario. Worth confirming live rather than assuming fixed, but the mechanism that caused it (full-viewport positioning with nothing to keep controls clear of screen edges) is gone either way.

---

## V3.45.7 — Timer relocated to a true, app-wide floating overlay (2026-08-10)

**Files touched:** `index.html`, `css/detail-pages.css`, `js/dhorPage.js`, `js/logDetailScreen.js`, `js/auth.js`, `js/home.js`, `js/sw.js`, `TODO.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.

The Dhor timer was, since V3.34, a permanent 4th card in the Sabaq/Sabaq Dhor/Dhor swipe rail — always present, but only reachable by first navigating to that one screen and swiping to it. This version moves it out of the rail and out of the screen it lived inside entirely, to a true sibling of the app's own top-level shell, so it can be opened from anywhere and — the real point of the request — stay visible while running no matter where the student navigates to next.

That last part turned out to already be broken in a subtle way worth being upfront about: the timer's "mini" floating mode already had real `position: fixed` styling, and an existing comment claimed it "floats free... independent of which card is in view." Checked directly before touching anything, and that was only ever true within the log-detail screen itself — a `position: fixed` element is still fully removed from rendering the moment any ancestor gets `display: none`, which is exactly what happens to the entire screen the instant the student navigates anywhere else. The fix isn't a CSS tweak; it's relocating the element itself, which is what most of this delivery is.

`openFloatingTimer()`/`closeFloatingTimer()` (`js/dhorPage.js`) replace the old rail-scrolling logic entirely — every entry point now just un-hides the relocated element directly and sets it to minimized, matching the confirmed default (maximizing stays the student's own deliberate action from there, unchanged). Three new entry points exist now: a timer icon on Sabaq's, Sabaq Dhor's, and Dhor's own header rows specifically (not Tadabbur), plus a dropdown entry and a Home tile, both added the same hardcoded way "Home" itself was — `NAV_ITEMS` is built around navigating to full screens, which this isn't.

One thing that fell out for free rather than needing its own logic: "never hidden while running." Once the timer is outside `showScreen()`'s reach entirely, the only way it's ever hidden again is the explicit Close action — which already resets the session first, every time, so it's never actually possible to end up with a hidden-but-still-running timer in the first place. No event-listening machinery needed for that part at all, just the relocation itself.

---

## V3.45.6 — Checkbox sizing resolved for real (2026-08-10)

**Files touched:** `css/detail-pages.css`, `js/sabaqDhorPage.js`, `index.html`, `js/sw.js`, `TODO.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.

V3.45.5's checkbox sizing fix — explicit `width`/`height` on the native checkboxes themselves — didn't hold up in practice, confirmed via a live screenshot showing the section checkboxes still rendering tiny while a checkbox targeted by the exact same rule right below them rendered correctly. The likely reason: native checkboxes don't always respect explicit dimensions consistently across browsers the way other elements do — a real, known limitation, not something specific to how that one rule was written.

This version sidesteps the problem entirely rather than fighting it further. A new shared `.checkbox-box` class wraps each checkbox in a plain, bordered container — same visual style `.verse-ref-field` already established — sized explicitly at 44×44px. A container element reliably respects CSS sizing regardless of browser; the checkbox inside it stays completely unstyled. The section-row text labels get the same bordered-box treatment for visual consistency, matching an annotated screenshot that specified this precisely.

Alignment needed its own small fix: the section list's checkbox column moves from `auto` to a fixed `44px`, matching `.checkbox-box`'s own width exactly, so it lines up with the manual-selection row's own checkbox-box even though the two sit in genuinely different layout contexts (one inside a CSS grid, one in a plain flex row). The manual field itself gets restructured along the way — the checkbox, which used to live inside the "Set Sabaq Dhor" label itself, moves out into its own boxed container next to the picker, exactly where the screenshot showed it should sit.

---

## V3.45.5 — Sabaq Dhor manual field: rebuilt to match what it actually is (2026-08-10)

**Files touched:** `js/position.js`, `js/sabaqDhorPage.js`, `index.html`, `css/detail-pages.css`, `js/sw.js`, `TODO.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.

V3.45.4 shipped Sabaq Dhor's manual-select field as a persistent override on stored position — set it once, and it would take precedence over the computed frontier until a new Sabaq entry cleared it automatically. Further conversation revealed that was the wrong shape entirely. The field turned out to be something much simpler: a third way to contribute to the exact same composited from/to range Sabaq Dhor's own section checkboxes already build for whichever single entry is about to be saved — nothing about it needs to persist beyond that one save, and it has no bearing whatsoever on Sabaq Dhor's own future "current" position, which continues unconditionally being built from the most recent Sabaq entry regardless of anything ever entered here.

`sabaqDhorManualOverride` comes back out entirely — `js/position.js` no longer stores or clears it, since it no longer exists at all. `compositeCheckedSabaqDhorRows` gets extended instead: when the new checkbox is checked, its surah:ayah point competes in the same earliest-start/latest-end comparison the section checkboxes' own rows already go through, not a separate calculation running alongside it. Verified directly with 5 Node scenarios before delivery, including the specific edge case of the manual value correctly extending an existing section-based range further, and a manual-checked-but-empty case falling back gracefully with no crash.

The checkbox itself is now genuinely passive — the old `#sabaqDhorManualSaveBtn` click handler is gone completely, since there's no longer a separate "save" action for it to trigger. It behaves exactly like the 2 existing "Confirm Sabaq Dhor" checkboxes: no listener of its own, read once, at the moment the card's own Save button is tapped.

Three more confirmed changes land in the same delivery: the manual section now sits below the auto (section-based) one rather than above it; "Set current position manually" becomes "Set Sabaq Dhor," now labeling the checkbox directly rather than sitting above the picker as its own separate label; and "Mark sections revised" becomes "Confirm Sabaq Dhor." A checkbox sizing bug also gets fixed — both `.sabaqDhor-row-cb` and the new checkbox get explicit `20px × 20px` sizing from the app's own `768px` breakpoint up, since neither had any CSS at all before this and was rendering at each browser's own small native default on desktop/tablet. Deliberately scoped by class/id rather than touching `.cb-private-row` globally, since Sabaq's own "Confirm selection" checkbox uses that same class and was already confirmed rendering correctly — changing it globally would have resized something nobody reported as a problem.

## V3.45.4 — Sabaq/Sabaq Dhor position rebuilt around real history (2026-08-10)

**Files touched:** `js/position.js`, `js/sabaqPage.js`, `js/sabaqDhorPage.js`, `index.html`, `js/sw.js`, `TODO.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.

The prepopulation bug from earlier — Sabaq showing 3:160 instead of the expected 3:166, Sabaq Dhor's "current" quarter stuck a full entry behind — got the architectural fix it needed rather than a patch on top of the mechanism that broke. `position.sabaqTo` and `position.activeJuz` are no longer stored anywhere at all. `computeActualSabaqFrontier` (new, `js/position.js`) computes the frontier fresh every time, directly from actual Sabaq history, so there's nothing left to silently desync from what genuinely happened — which is exactly what broke originally, a `savePosition()` call failing silently with zero trace while the Sabaq entry itself saved correctly.

The algorithm went through a real correction mid-design. The first draft tried to determine which juz' was "further along" across a student's whole history, using the same `SABAQ_STUDY_ORDER`-based comparison `advancePositionAfterSabaq` already trusted elsewhere. The user caught a genuine flaw in that: study order is only actually fixed through juz' 30 then 29 — after that, students genuinely diverge, with no single system to code against. The final design sidesteps this entirely rather than trying to solve it: the default frontier is simply whichever Sabaq entry is most recently dated, full stop, no cross-juz' comparison anywhere.

Sabaq Dhor gains a capability it never had before: a manual override, confirmed to visually and structurally match Sabaq's own picker fields exactly, though implemented as its own dedicated set of functions rather than generalizing Sabaq's tightly-coupled existing ones — deliberately, to avoid any risk of regressing Sabaq's own already-working picker in the process. No separate "reset" action exists anywhere for this override — logging a new Sabaq entry clears it automatically, confirmed directly as the intended mechanism.

A real bug in this delivery's own first draft got caught and fixed before it shipped: with `sabaqTo`/`activeJuz` now living only in memory (for the existing row-computation functions, entirely unchanged, to keep reading), naively passing that same in-memory object to `savePosition` at any of several call sites would have accidentally persisted them right back into storage — quietly recreating the exact class of bug this version exists to eliminate. Fixed centrally instead: `savePosition` itself now strips both fields before every write, regardless of what it's handed, so no individual call site needs to remember to do this correctly on its own.

Every row-computation function downstream — `computeLingeringRows`, `computeSabaqDhorRows`, `computeCurrentJuzRows`, `computeSabaqDhorSections`, `computeSabaqDhorSectionsMaqra`, `maybeAutoMoveToDhor` — is completely unchanged. All of it verified directly against the real production code before writing any of this delivery: the actual `shared/data.js` and `js/position.js` loaded into Node, run through the exact originally-reported scenario end-to-end (both Sabaq's prepopulation and Sabaq Dhor's own display independently landing on the correct 3:166/3:165), plus 6 further frontier scenarios and the `savePosition` stripping fix itself.

## V3.45.3 — Native confirm() + Settings link to the Juz Tracker (2026-08-09)

**Files touched:** `index.html`, `css/settings.css`, `js/juzTrackerScreen.js`, `js/settingsScreen.js`, `js/sw.js`, `TODO.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.

The Juz Tracker's confirmation dialog moves from the custom modal built in V3.45 to a native `confirm()` — a richer, 2-part message that shows both what's about to change and, separately, the complete resulting list of every juz that will be marked complete once saved, grouped 3 per line for readability. `formatJuzListThreePerLine` and `buildJuzConfirmMessage` (`js/juzTrackerScreen.js`) do this work, and both are shared with the Settings "Mark completed Juz" grid, which previously had no confirmation of any kind when closed — now it gets the exact same message, computed the same way. Verified the message-building logic directly against 4 scenarios (marking, un-marking, both together, and the edge case where the resulting list becomes empty) before delivery.

The Settings link to the Juz Tracker — deferred back when the tracker itself was first planned — is in now. The label above the button changes from "Mark completed sections," a leftover from when Surah-based history still existed, to "Mark completed Juz," matching what the button itself already said. A new switch lets the student pick between the visual tracker (the default) and the existing list-style grid, reusing the app's own established switch component rather than building something new — the tracker option is represented by its own icon rather than text, which needed its own explicit sizing since the generic icon-button class it's built from had never carried any sizing rules of its own before this. The existing button's own click handler now checks the switch's current selection and opens whichever method is chosen.

## V3.45.2 — Tadabbur card sizing fix (2026-08-09)

**Files touched:** `css/detail-pages.css`, `index.html`, `js/sw.js`, `TODO.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.

The card-not-filling-available-space issue from V3.45.1 traced back to a genuinely subtle root cause, found by the user rather than guessed at: the flex relationship was broken two levels above `#tadabburCard`, not at the card's own level. `#appContent` never established `display: flex` for its own children, so `#screen-reflections` — and `#tadabburCard` inside it — was never actually forced to fill the space its own `min-height` set aside. Each level's `min-height` happened to be independently viewport-relative, which is exactly why reading any single rule in isolation never revealed a conflict.

Two ways to fix this were on the table. Extending the flex chain properly up through `#appContent` and `.screen` would have worked, but those are shared rules every screen in the app depends on — fixing one card by restructuring what all of them sit on was too much risk for this. The chosen fix stays entirely inside Tadabbur's own card: `#tadabburCard`'s `min-height` becomes `height`, same formula, same values. `#tadabburCard`'s own `display: flex; flex-direction: column` and `#tadabbur_text`'s own `flex: 1; min-height: 0` were correct all along — what was missing was the card having a definite size, not just a minimum, for that already-correct internal relationship to actually distribute space within. `height` alone still lets genuinely long content push the card taller, since nothing here constrains overflow.

## V3.45.1 — Tadabbur regression fixes + History (2026-08-09)

**Files touched:** `index.html`, `css/detail-pages.css`, `js/reflectionCard.js`, `js/dhorPage.js`, `js/sw.js`, `TODO.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.

Two real regressions from V3.44.1, found via a live screenshot, plus a feature that was missed in that same round.

The date field's invisible-text problem traced back to a genuine gap: `#tadabbur_date` was a plain, unwrapped input, while every other date input in the app (`.card-date-row`, used by Sabaq/Sabaq Dhor/Dhor) gives its input an explicit, fixed height before `wireCustomDateDisplay` wraps it — that wrapping mechanism's own `height: 100%` styling depends entirely on that fixed-height parent existing. Tadabbur's field now sits inside the same `.card-date-row` wrapper as everywhere else, which needed `--dhor-row2-h` (normally supplied by the `.detail-page` class, which this card doesn't carry) defined directly on `#tadabburCard` instead — pulling in the whole `.detail-page` class for one variable would have brought its unrelated label/input/textarea styling along with it, so this was the more surgical fix.

The close button moves out of the header row's own layout entirely and gets pinned to the card's top-right corner with `position: absolute`, the same technique `.modal-card .close-btn` already uses for corner × buttons elsewhere in the app — `#tadabburCard` picked up `position: relative` as the anchor point this needed.

Tadabbur now has a History button, reusing `js/dhorPage.js`'s `renderRecentEntries` — the same function already powering Sabaq, Sabaq Dhor, and Dhor's own history. It gained one new capability for this: an opt-in `onRowClick` parameter, purely additive so the 3 existing callers are entirely unaffected by not passing it. Tapping a history entry's edit-pencil icon loads it into the form for editing, exactly like the other 3 types already work. Tapping the entry's own content instead opens a plain read-only view of the full date and reflection text — new UI that didn't exist anywhere in the app before this, since none of the other 3 types have a row-level tap interaction, only their edit icon. Each row in the list shows the entry's first line, truncated at 60 characters — verified against several edge cases (multi-line text, a very long single line, empty and whitespace-only reflections) before delivery.

One thing intentionally left alone: the reflection textarea still isn't flexing to fill its card the way it's meant to, and this version doesn't claim to have fixed it. The CSS reads correctly and nothing found during this pass explains the mismatch with the live screenshot — rather than guess at a change with no confirmed reason behind it, this stays flagged in `TODO.md` for a closer look, worth rechecking after this delivery in case the surrounding restructuring changed anything incidentally.

## V3.45 — Juz Tracker connected to the Dhor pool (2026-08-09)

**Files touched:** `index.html`, `css/juzTracker.css`, `js/juzTrackerScreen.js`, `js/kaabaTracker.js`, `js/app.js`, `js/sw.js`, `TODO.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.

The Juz Tracker was, until this version, a self-contained puzzle with no connection to a student's actual memorization data — a full session-only "free play" mode. This connects it to the same Dhor pool (`students.baseline_selection`) the existing Settings picker already reads from and writes to.

**Loading**: `renderJuzTrackerScreen` now runs every time the screen is entered (replacing what used to be a one-time setup function that only ran once at page load), fetching the student's profile and coloring a tile for any juz with all 4 of its quarter-units already present in the pool — the same "complete" rule the existing picker uses, via the same `quarterUnitsForJuz` helper.

**Saving** is a genuinely careful piece, given the real risk of silently corrupting actual memorization progress if this went wrong. Tapping the new Save icon diffs the tracker's current state against what was loaded at entry, and if anything changed, shows a confirmation modal listing exactly what's about to happen — which juz are newly marked complete, which are newly un-marked, both if the same session did both — with OK to proceed or Cancel to go back and adjust. On OK, only the specific juz actually touched get written: their 4 quarter-units added or removed from a freshly re-fetched copy of the pool, leaving every other juz completely untouched. This was a deliberate choice over rebuilding the whole pool from the tracker's current tile state, the way the existing Settings picker does — a full rebuild would have carried the exact same edge-case risk already found in that picker's own code (documented separately, not fixed as part of this): if the tracker's own load ever missed detecting an already-complete juz, saving would silently drop it. The targeted approach sidesteps that entirely rather than reproducing it on a new screen. Verified directly with 4 Node-run scenarios before delivery, including the specific case this whole design exists to protect — a partial juz already in the pool (simulating Sabaq Dhor's own leftover progress, which only ever moves whole juz, never partial ones) stays completely untouched by an unrelated save elsewhere on the tracker.

The header is restructured to match what was asked for specifically on this screen, different from the pattern used everywhere else: a white background instead of the screen's own `--surface-track`, Save sitting immediately next to the "Juz Tracker" heading rather than grouped with Close, and Close pushed separately to the far right.

The sizing problem — the cube running past the bottom of the visible viewport on a wide desktop window, confirmed via 2 screenshots — turned out to require touching `js/kaabaTracker.js` directly rather than the screen's own CSS: the component renders inside a shadow DOM, and its `.kt-svg` styling lives entirely inside that boundary, unreachable from ordinary external stylesheets. A `max-height: 70vh` there now keeps the whole cube visible without scrolling, on any screen size.

No backend changes were needed anywhere in this — `POST /profile` already fully supported writing `baseline_selection`, confirmed by reading the handler directly rather than assuming.

## V3.44.1 — Tadabbur redesign (2026-08-09)

**Files touched:** `index.html`, `css/detail-pages.css`, `js/customDate.js`, `js/reflectionCard.js`, `js/sw.js`, `TODO.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.

A full redesign of the Tadabbur screen, scoped deliberately to frontend-only work — "no new backend for now" — after the fuller version of this request (an ayah chooser, real hashtag search) turned out to need a new migration and got pushed to a later round.

The header row — icon, "Tadabbur" title, Save, and the close button — moves inside the white card as its first child now, the same structural pattern Sabaq's own `.log-detail-card` already uses, rather than sitting outside the card on the screen's own background. A date field is new (`#tadabbur_date`) — `reflections.date` already existed in the schema, it just wasn't exposed anywhere in the UI before this, so no migration was needed. It's wired the same way Sabaq's date field already works: not a dynamic reload when changed, just "which date this entry is for," read once at save time — which means backdating a reflection now works the same way backdating a Sabaq log already did. The private checkbox moves above the reflection textarea instead of below it, and that textarea now flexes to fill the card (`flex: 1`, bigger 18px text) instead of sitting at a fixed `rows="8"`, which needed the card itself to become a flex column with a real height to grow into.

The card also gets its own width exception — 50%, deliberately not the standard 30/50 rule, staying at 50% even past the `1180px` breakpoint where the shared `.screen-content` class would otherwise narrow it to 30% — more room for long reflection text was the explicit reason. A third named exception now, alongside Journal's 70% and Juz Tracker's full width, each for its own stated reason rather than an arbitrary one.

Caught and fixed during this build: an early edit accidentally deleted `.log-detail-rail`'s own CSS properties while adding a section comment above it. Found and corrected immediately via direct inspection, before anything was delivered.

**Follow-up, same version**: the flagged backend limitation is now resolved too — `worker/src/reflections.js`'s update path can write `date`. This wasn't the simple one-line whitelist edit it first looked like, though: `FIELDS` is shared with the create path, and `insertLog` zips that array with its own `values` array by *position* to build the INSERT statement. Adding `date` there would have left `FIELDS` at 3 items against `values`' still-2, silently misaligning every column after it — caught via direct verification before delivery, not left to be discovered later. Fixed instead with a separate `UPDATE_FIELDS` whitelist used only by the update path, which matches fields by name rather than position, so it doesn't share that risk. Verified directly with a Node simulation of both paths before shipping: the create path is unaffected, and the update path now correctly picks up a `date` key when present.

## V3.44 — Core color inversion, content wrappers, breakpoint corrections (2026-08-09)

**Files touched:** `index.html`, `css/tokens.css`, `css/base.css`, `css/settings.css`, `css/admin.css`, `css/haidh.css`, `css/journal-table.css`, `js/auth.js`, `js/sw.js`, `TODO.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.

The full build of the redesign thread that followed V3.43 — a genuine reversal of that release's color assignment, prompted by realizing `.journal-wrap` and each `.settings-section` already occupied the same hierarchical role (a white card of actual content, directly inside its screen), which made it clear the pattern belonged everywhere, not just on Settings.

**The core inversion**: `#appContent` is now `--color-page-bg` (was `--surface-track`); every individual screen is now `--surface-track` (was white). Screens picked up real padding (10px on every side), rounded corners, and their own min-height formula — mirroring `#appContent`'s own, additionally subtracting `#appContent`'s padding via the existing `--appcontent-vpad` token, the same technique already used for Log Detail's cards and the Timer.

A new shared class, `.screen-content` (`css/base.css`), is where the standard "white, 30/50-capped" treatment now lives — white background, the cap, its own padding and radius. Tadabbur, Haidh, and Admin all get a new body-content wrapper using it; Settings' 4 sections switch to it too, replacing the width-cap rule they used to duplicate individually.

**Settings** loses its `--surface-app` special case entirely — it's just another `--surface-track` screen now, no longer different from anything else. `--surface-app` is retired from active use (the token stays defined, nothing references it).

**Journal**'s old negative-margin technique — built to bleed the table to the screen's raw edges — is removed, since it's fundamentally incompatible with the new confirmed exception: `.journal-header-row` and `.journal-wrap` together get a fixed 70% width and center themselves, the same shape as Juz Tracker's existing full-width exemption, rather than following the standard cap a 4-column table doesn't have room for.

**Haidh and Admin** both had the identical, previously-undiscovered gap: their body content sat directly in the screen with no wrapper of its own, relying entirely on a screen-level cap for width control. Haidh's was also where a confirmed rendering bug lived — the calendar spanning the full browser width with no restriction at all on a wide desktop window. Both screens' old screen-level caps are removed, and their content now lives inside its own `.screen-content` wrapper instead, with an explicit width control point that doesn't depend on whatever was going wrong before.

**Three breakpoint corrections**, all converging on the same number: `--appcontent-vpad` and `#appContent`'s own padding both move from 720px to 768px; `#appContent`'s `max-width` (which stays Hifzhelper's own 1400px, not stdstyles' 1280px) moves from 1200px to 1180px. All three now match the `--width-tablet`/`--width-desktop` breakpoints already used everywhere else in the app, rather than three separate systems disagreeing across small windows of viewport width.

**The dropdown menu** gets a "Home" entry, added the same way Refresh and Log Out already were — hardcoded directly rather than added to `NAV_ITEMS`, so it doesn't also duplicate into Home's own tile grid.

One thing deliberately left alone: `#screen-home` still carries its own separate screen-level width cap, the same pattern just removed from Settings, Admin, and Haidh. It was never part of the explicitly-named list this round, so it's untouched rather than assumed — worth a decision on consistency, flagged in `TODO.md`.

---

## V3.43 — `#appContent`/screen architecture, rebased on real V3.41.2 (2026-08-09)

**Files touched:** `index.html`, `css/tokens.css`, `css/base.css`, `css/nav.css`, `css/settings.css`, `css/detail-pages.css`, `js/sw.js`, `TODO.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.

Built directly from the real, currently-live V3.41.2 — the user confirmed an earlier V3.42/V3.42.1 pass (from a previous chat session's sandbox) was never actually implemented, and uploaded the genuine current repo to build from instead. Final agreed terminology, after a few rounds of correcting the mapping: `#appContent` (the one persistent wrapper, never swapped) is the user's "screen"; each individual `#screen-home`/`#screen-journal`/`#screen-haidhDetail`/etc. is the user's "container."

**New tokens** (`css/tokens.css`) — `--surface-app: #EBE5D9`, `--surface-track: #A2ABA1`, `--surface-banner: #4A5D4E` (this value was corrected mid-conversation from an earlier `#758976`), `--surface-contrast: #9E83B8`. Plus a new `--appcontent-vpad` helper — mobile `--space-md`, `--space-lg` from 720px, matching `#appContent`'s own existing padding breakpoint exactly — reused below rather than duplicating that condition in multiple places.

**`#appContent`** gets `background: var(--surface-track)` and an explicit `min-height` (`100vh`/`100dvh` minus the auth band). This is mostly making explicit what its existing `flex:1` inside `#appShell`'s flex column already provided implicitly — kept as `min-height`, not a fixed `height`, specifically so genuinely long content can still grow past it and the page scrolls normally, rather than ever clipping.

**Every individual screen is white by default now** (a new `.screen` rule in `css/base.css`, targeting the `class="screen"` already present on every screen section) — including Home, whose olive-specific `#screen-home` background from V3.41.1 is removed entirely, no longer a special case.

**Settings is the one deliberate exception**, confirmed explicitly and then reconfirmed: `#screen-settings` keeps its own distinct `--surface-app` backdrop instead of the universal white, with its 4 sections (Profile, Hifz Setup, Dhor Schedule, Haidh) staying white inside it — a second, nested instance of the same "colored backdrop, white cards" pattern the rest of the app now has one layer up, specific to this one screen. The sections' own background changed from `--palette-sky` to white to match. Settings' existing 30/50 width cap needed no changes at all — it already matched what "containers get the 30/50 rule" was asking for.

**Home's header text is deleted entirely** — just the lavender `home` icon remains in the header row, no `<h2>Home</h2>` at all. The white-heading-text fix from V3.41.1 (needed for contrast against the old olive background) is removed as dead code along with it.

**Log Detail and the Timer both get a height recalibration.** `.log-detail-card` (both its normal and `.editing-active` states) and `#dhorTimerHost` (both its normal and `>=1180px` desktop states) all now also subtract `#appContent`'s own vertical padding from their `height` formulas, via the new `--appcontent-vpad` token. These formulas predate `#appContent` having any explicit sizing of its own, so none of them ever accounted for that padding eating into the available space — without this fix they'd each run past the visible viewport by exactly that amount, which is exactly the class of bug this round was raised to prevent.

---

## V3.41.2 — Home tile, fixed sizing, 30/50 cap, darker border (2026-08-08)

**Files touched:** `js/home.js`, `css/nav.css`, `js/sw.js`, `TODO.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.

Four refinements to V3.41.1's Home screen, confirmed against a reference image showing the exact intended look.

**A real "Home" tile**, prepended as the first item inside `#homeGrid` itself — distinct from V3.41.1's header icon, which stays. Deliberately not added to `NAV_ITEMS`, since that would also put it in the dropdown on every other screen, redundant with the X-to-Home buttons already there — hardcoded directly in `renderHomeScreen()` instead, Home-page-only. It's always shown active: a lavender-filled box with a visibly darker lavender-toned border (derived from `--palette-lavender` itself via `color-mix()`, not a new hardcoded color), while the icon and label stay dark ink rather than turning lavender the way the generic cross-screen highlight does elsewhere — a distinct, more specific treatment scoped so it only affects this one tile. No `data-nav` attribute and no click handler, since there's nothing meaningful for a tap to do when you're already on Home, and `showScreen`'s active-highlight loop only ever touches `[data-nav]` elements, so this tile's permanent active state can't be toggled off by it.

**Fixed tile sizing** — `#homeGrid` moves from a stretching CSS grid (`1fr` columns, tiles grew or shrank with the viewport) to `flex-wrap`, with each tile now a constant 76px wide and its icon box a constant 64px square — tiles simply wrap onto a new row if there isn't room, rather than stretching to fill whatever space is available.

**30/50 width cap** — `#screen-home` gets the same tablet/desktop width cap every other capped screen already has; it had simply never been given one.

**Darker tile border** — was `--color-table-border` (which resolves to `--palette-lavender`, `#E3DADE`), barely visible against a white tile. Now `--color-ink-faint` (`#9A9A90`), matching the clearly visible medium-gray outline in the reference image.

---

## V3.41.1 — Home screen redesign: olive/white/lavender, landing page, Progress removed (2026-08-08)

**Files touched:** `index.html`, `js/auth.js`, `js/app.js`, `js/icons.js`, `css/nav.css`, `css/base.css`, `js/sw.js`, `TODO.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.

A full Home screen restructure plus two smaller navigation corrections, confirmed in chat right after V3.41 shipped the first pass at the tile restyle.

**Home's new look** — the screen background is now olive, reusing `--palette-sage` (the exact color the top auth band already uses — no new color introduced). Home gets a real header (a `card-header-row` with a `home` icon, colored lavender) where it previously had only a bare `<h2>`; the heading text itself is now white for contrast against the olive, a necessary follow-on rather than something separately requested. `#homeGrid` becomes its own white container sitting on top of that olive background, with the tiles arranged inside it.

**Tile structure, corrected** — V3.41's restyle put the background/border/shadow chip around the whole tile (icon + label sharing one box). This was structural, not cosmetic, per this round: `js/auth.js`'s `renderNavItemsInto` now wraps each icon in its own `.nav-icon-item-icon` span, separate from the label, and only Home's CSS boxes that icon span specifically — square, white background, thin border, rounded corners, shadow — with the label sitting below it, outside the box, matching a standard phone-home-screen icon convention. The dropdown menu picks up the same new markup but stays visually identical, since the wrapper is neutral by default and only `#homeGrid`'s own rules add the chip look; the Refresh/Log out items (hardcoded outside the shared render function) were updated to the same structure too, for consistency, even though they only ever appear in the dropdown.

**Two corrections to what V3.41 shipped**: the active-screen nav highlight is now lavender instead of evergreen — flagging one thing for a look once live: lavender is a pale color and the dropdown's own background is white, so the contrast there will read soft/subtle rather than bold. Built exactly as specified since it was stated clearly and repeated, but worth confirming it reads the way it's meant to.

**Navigation changes** — Home now replaces Journal as the screen a returning user lands on after login (`bootApp()`, `js/app.js`); a new user with setup still incomplete is unaffected, and Journal remains fully reachable as its own nav item either way. "Progress" (the coming-soon placeholder for the not-yet-built gamified dhor-rings map) is deleted from `NAV_ITEMS` entirely, and its now-orphaned icon definition removed from `js/icons.js` too — confirmed via search to have no other callers anywhere.

---

## V3.41 — X-to-Home everywhere, Home tile restyle, active-nav highlight (2026-08-08)

**Files touched:** `index.html`, `js/app.js`, `js/logDetailScreen.js`, `css/detail-pages.css`, `css/nav.css`, `css/base.css`, `js/sw.js`, `TODO.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.

Three related, app-wide navigation additions, confirmed in chat after noticing the app had no dedicated way to leave a screen anywhere — every screen relied on the top dropdown menu alone.

**X-to-Home** — every screen except Home itself (Journal, Log Detail, Admin, Settings, Tadabbur, Haidh, Juz Tracker) now has a close button that always returns to Home, reusing the existing `close` icon throughout rather than introducing a new one. `screen-logDetail` already had a close button (`logDetailClose`) — it went to Journal specifically, by deliberate earlier design (there's no navigation history stack anywhere in the app, so a fixed target was the only option, and Journal was that screen's own "reached-from" page). Confirmed in chat to repoint that one to Home too, for full consistency. Every other close button is wired centrally in `js/app.js`'s own `init()` — they're all identical (same icon, same `showScreen('home')` action), so one loop covers all six rather than repeating the same two lines across six separate files.

Placement varied a lot by screen, since header structure isn't uniform across the app: the three screens with an existing `card-header-row` (Tadabbur, Haidh, Juz Tracker) get the button in that row's right-hand column — Tadabbur already had save controls living there, so a small new `.card-header-right` wrapper holds both side by side rather than the two fighting for the same grid slot. Admin had no header row at all before this (just a bare `<h2>`), so it gets a real one now, reusing the existing `admin` icon. Settings (four independent sections, no single screen-level header) and Journal (its own data-table header, not a card header) both get a small dedicated row at the very top of the screen instead.

**Home tile restyle** — `#homeGrid`'s tiles now read as distinct app icons: a background chip, rounded corners, and a subtle shadow, considerably more visual weight than the plain icon+label style. Scoped specifically to `#homeGrid .nav-icon-item` so the dropdown menu's own tiles — same underlying class — are completely unaffected. CSS only; same tiles, same destinations, same `renderNavItemsInto` markup underneath.

**Active-screen highlight** — whichever screen is currently open gets its own nav icon shown in accent color, in both the dropdown and the Home grid at once, reusing the exact visual language `.log-detail-dots .dot.active` already established rather than inventing a new one (`currentColor` on the icon means a single `color` rule recolors both the icon and its label together). `showScreen` (`js/app.js`) updates this on every navigation call — placed deliberately *after* any screen-specific render, since `renderHomeScreen` rebuilds `#homeGrid`'s entire markup from scratch every time it runs, which would silently wipe an earlier-set highlight.

---

## V3.40.5 — Haidh calendar: width cap, confirm-bar icons, cross-month ranges (2026-08-08)

**Files touched:** `index.html`, `js/haidhDetailScreen.js`, `css/haidh.css`, `js/sw.js`, `TODO.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.

Three small, independent items, one of them requiring no code change at all.

**Width cap** — `#screen-haidhDetail` gets the app's standard 30%/50% width cap on tablet/desktop (`--width-tablet`/`--width-desktop`, `tokens.css`), the same pattern already used by `#screen-settings`/`#screen-admin`/`.login-card`. It had simply never been given the cap before — unrelated to Juz Tracker's own deliberate full-width exemption, which was a specific opt-out for a different screen.

**Confirm-bar icons** — the confirm/predict button and Cancel both now carry an icon alongside their text. The confirm button reuses the `save` icon (same one Settings' own Haidh section save button already uses, for visual consistency across the feature), added via `innerHTML` alongside its existing dynamic "Confirm as haidh"/"Predict as haidh" text. Cancel reuses `close` (the same icon the Dhor timer already uses for its own discard/cancel action), set once at module load since its label never changes.

**Cross-month range selection** — turned out to already work, verified by tracing every place `haidhRangeStart`/`haidhRangeEnd` are read: none of them, nor `haidhPendingRangeBounds`, `onHaidhCalDayTap`, `renderHaidhRangeBar`, or `onHaidhRangeConfirm`, ever reference which month is currently displayed (`haidhCalViewYear`/`haidhCalViewMonth`) — the pending range is plain date strings throughout. Tapping a day, navigating to a different month via prev/next, and tapping a day there already produces a valid range. No behavior changed; added a comment documenting this as a real requirement so a future edit doesn't accidentally scope range state to the current view.

## V3.40.4 — Haidh calendar: confirm/predict as one decision per range (2026-08-08)

**Files touched:** `index.html`, `js/haidhDetailScreen.js`, `shared/haidhRules.js`, `worker/src/attendance.js`, `js/sw.js`, `TODO.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.

Simplifies the marking model, confirmed in chat right after V3.40.3's fixes made the calendar visible again. Previously, a new range's status was decided per date automatically (past/today → `haidh`, future → `predicted-haidh`), so a period starting today and running a few days ahead would end up "today confirmed, the rest predicted" — which doesn't reflect reality once a period has actually started. Now the whole range gets one uniform status, decided once: "confirmed" if it touches today or the past — including transitively, through an adjacent existing mark — and "predicted" only if it's entirely future with no such connection. `evaluateHaidhRange` (`shared/haidhRules.js`) already computed the extended run's start for validation purposes; this reuses that same `runStart` rather than adding parallel logic. `handleMarkHaidhRange` (`worker/src/attendance.js`) now assigns one status to every date in the batch instead of branching per date.

The confirm bar's button reflects this before the student commits — "Confirm as haidh" or "Predict as haidh" instead of a generic "Mark as haidh" — via a new client-side `haidhRangeTouchesPastOrToday()` that mirrors the server's own extension logic using the already-loaded `haidhCalAttendance`. Tapping an already-marked day to clear it needed no changes — that already was, and still is, the correct 2-state toggle for a single day.

Rejection messages (duration cap and gap rule, in both `handleMarkHaidhRange` and `handleSetAttendance` for consistency) now end with "Please revise your history." rather than only stating which rule failed.

The new status-decision logic was verified directly against 5 concrete scenarios before delivery — including the one that matters most: a future range that connects to an existing run touching today correctly becomes confirmed, while a future range merely adjacent to another future-only run correctly stays predicted rather than being wrongly upgraded.

## V3.40.3 — Haidh calendar: 3 real bugs, all fixed and verified (2026-08-08)

**Files touched:** `index.html`, `js/haidhDetailScreen.js`, `shared/haidhRules.js`, `worker/src/attendance.js`, `js/sw.js`, `js/juzTrackerScreen.js` (re-included, was missing from the live deploy), `TODO.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.

Three separate, independently-diagnosed bugs, found over an extended live debugging session (Network tab, DOM inspector, and direct console evaluation on the actual production site) rather than from code review alone — each verified against the real, edited files before this delivery, not just reasoned through.

**The actual reason nothing showed on the calendar:** `loadHaidhCalAttendance` did `const { data } = await apiGetAttendance();` — but `apiGetAttendance()` already resolves directly to the array, since `worker/src/index.js`'s `respond()` always unwraps handler results to `result.data` before sending the HTTP response. There's no extra `.data` wrapper on the client side to destructure. `data` was therefore always `undefined`, and `haidhCalAttendance` was *always* an empty object, regardless of any date computation — confirmed live: `apiGetAttendance()` called directly in the browser console returned the real 17-row array with no wrapper, while `loadHaidhCalAttendance()` called the exact same way still left the object empty. Fixed with a one-line change; grepped the whole frontend for the same destructuring mistake and it's the only occurrence anywhere.

**A second, separate, genuinely real bug this one had been masking:** `renderHaidhCalGrid`'s 3 cell-building loops computed each square's date via `new Date(year, month, day).toISOString().slice(0,10)`. `new Date(y,m,d)` constructs *local* midnight, but `.toISOString()` always converts to UTC — so for any timezone ahead of UTC (the device here is set to South African Standard Time, UTC+2), the computed date silently shifts backward by a day, even though the number printed on the square looks unaffected. Verified directly: `new Date(2026,7,8)` in `Africa/Johannesburg` becomes `"2026-08-07"` after `.toISOString()`, not `"2026-08-08"`. A new `haidhLocalISO()` helper reads the constructed date's own local year/month/day back out directly instead, avoiding the UTC round-trip entirely — correct for any timezone or offset direction. `haidhTodayISO()` (built from `new Date()`, the actual current instant, not a locally-constructed date) and `shared/haidhRules.js`'s `haidhAddDaysISO` (uses `Date.UTC()` explicitly) were never affected by this — it was isolated to this one screen's grid rendering.

**Third, unrelated bug from the "15 days have not passed" report:** `evaluateHaidhRange` validated a proposed range by simulating each date in chronological order, checking the gap rule against only what had been added to a working set so far — so a range directly adjacent to (or overlapping) an already-marked block got wrongly rejected, since the first date checked hadn't "seen" the rest of its own range yet. Rewritten to evaluate the whole proposed range as one unit instead: extend the run outward from the range's own edges using only the true external existing dates, and only gap-check if neither edge touches an existing day. Re-verified against the original 9 scenarios plus 3 covering this exact bug, 12/12 correct, run again directly against the final edited files before delivery. This also resolves the earlier "marking should override predicted" note on its own — the write side (`ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE`) already did the right thing; the validation bug was the only thing blocking it. `handleMarkHaidhRange` updated for the function's new single-verdict return shape; `evaluateHaidhMark`/`handleSetAttendance`'s single-day path is untouched and unaffected.

`js/juzTrackerScreen.js` (found missing from the live deploy in the previous session, unrelated to any of the above) is included again here so one upload covers everything currently outstanding.

## V3.40.2 — Haidh calendar range-select (2026-08-08)

**Files touched:** `index.html`, `css/haidh.css`, `js/haidhDetailScreen.js`, `js/api.js`, `shared/haidhRules.js`, `worker/src/attendance.js`, `worker/src/index.js`, `TODO.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.

(User asked for this as "3.40.1" — bumped to 3.40.2 instead since 3.40.1's own files already shipped with different content, and every changed file needs a fresh version string regardless of what the round gets called, per this project's own versioning convention.)

Making a NEW haidh mark is now tap-first/tap-last range-select, replacing the old immediate single-tap-toggle — confirmed in chat, no separate "range select mode" button needed. Tap day 1 sets a pending start (new `.haidh-cal-day-selecting` highlight — a 3rd color, distinct from the existing confirmed/planned shading, so a still-editable selection never looks already-saved). Tap day 2 (same day again = a 1-day range) sets the end and highlights the whole span. Nothing is written until the new confirm bar's "Mark N days as haidh" is pressed — "Cancel" clears the pending selection instead. No minimum range length is enforced (corrected mid-spec by the user — realistic duration is a user-managed judgment call, not something the app validates a floor on; only the existing maximum-duration and gap caps still apply). Tapping an already-confirmed/planned day *outside* of an active selection still clears just that one day directly, unchanged from before — continuity with the original "tap a marked day to clear it," which only ever applied to removing.

**New `POST /attendance/mark-range`** (`worker/src/attendance.js`) is a genuinely atomic batch operation, not N sequential single-day calls — confirmed in chat: an invalid range must reject the whole batch, marking nothing. It fetches the student's existing haidh/predicted-haidh dates *outside* the proposed range, then validates every date *inside* the range in chronological order via a new `evaluateHaidhRange` (`shared/haidhRules.js`), which reuses `evaluateHaidhMark`'s exact existing per-date run-length/gap math by simulating adding each date to a growing working set — no duplicated validation logic, same single source of truth the rest of the Haidh caps already use. The very first date that would exceed the ruling's duration cap or violate the 15-day gap rule fails the whole request before anything is written; a fully valid range is then written in one `env.DB.batch()` call for genuine atomicity. Verified directly against 9 scenarios before considering this done: plain short ranges, exactly-at-cap and over-cap, a range that only becomes invalid once merged with an adjacent *existing* run (not just the new dates alone), both a gap violation and a gap-OK case, and both rulings.

**`apiSetAttendance`** (`js/api.js`) removed — its only caller was the old single-tap immediate-mark path this replaces. Backend `handleSetAttendance` and its route are deliberately untouched: that's the separately PARKED "attendance" decision in `TODO.md` (present/absent marking for a future teacher view), not something this change resolves.

---

## V3.40.1 — Juz Tracker button removal + Settings Haidh redesign + a real calendar bug fix (2026-08-08)

**Files touched:** `index.html`, `css/juzTracker.css`, `css/settings.css`, `js/settingsScreen.js`, `js/haidhDetailScreen.js`, `js/juzTrackerScreen.js` (new), `js/sw.js`, `TODO.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.

Three independent pieces of a "Haidh mods" + "Juz Tracker deletions" ask, all previously spec'd and documented in `TODO.md` before any code was touched, per the standing process rule. A 4th piece from the same ask — the Haidh calendar's tap-first/tap-last range-select and its highlight state — is deliberately NOT in this release; it was already flagged as "not yet designed in detail," and guessing at the interaction model felt wrong for something that writes real haidh data. Left open in `TODO.md` with the specific questions that need answering first.

**Juz Tracker** (`index.html`, `css/juzTracker.css`, `js/juzTrackerScreen.js` new) — both "Download SVG" and "Mark next juz" removed; marking a juz now only happens by tapping the tiles themselves, which was always wired independently of the control bar anyway. `js/kaabaTracker.js`'s `controls` attribute turned out to be all-or-nothing (`"full"` or `"none"`), so keeping the progress bar and Reset meant giving up the component's own built-in bar entirely and hand-building those two pieces instead — a small new file wires `juz-change` to a plain count/fill-bar readout and `el.reset()` to the Reset button, styled with the app's own tokens rather than the component's baked-in palette (which lives in its own Shadow DOM regardless).

**Settings Haidh section** (`index.html`, `css/settings.css`, `js/settingsScreen.js`) — heading text becomes "Haaidha", with the existing `#haaidha_checkbox` moved inline into the heading row itself (wrapped together in one `<label>`, so tapping the heading text also toggles it) — same element id throughout, so its save-on-change listener in `js/settingsScreen.js` needed no changes. The Ruling switch (Hanafi/Shafi'i) moves out of the label+input `.settings-row` pattern into its own centered row at 75% width — this incidentally fixes a real, visible bug: it was previously squeezed into `.switch-track-small`, a fixed-72px class built for the 2-letter M/F gender switch elsewhere, which is why "Shafi'i" was rendering as "Sha". `#haidhRulingHint` ("Hanafi: haidh cannot exceed 10 days.") is removed entirely — the element, and both places `js/settingsScreen.js` populated it via the now-also-removed `HAIDH_RULING_HINTS` lookup — this is UI copy only; the actual 10/15-day caps remain enforced server-side in `worker/src/profile.js`, untouched. The "Plans will be adjusted..." description paragraph moves from the top of the section to right after the Ruling row. The 3 numeric/date input rows get a shared `min-height` (`#section-haidh .settings-row`) so they're no longer uneven — 2 of the 3 labels wrap to 2 lines on mobile widths and 1 doesn't.

**Haidh calendar, real bug found and fixed** (`js/haidhDetailScreen.js`) — the prev/next month buttons were already correctly wired to `shiftHaidhCalMonth(-1/1)`, and `css/haidh.css` already had rotation rules ready for an icon (`.haidh-cal-prev svg`/`.haidh-cal-next svg`), but nothing anywhere had ever actually injected one — the buttons were fully functional but completely invisible, not just unstyled. Fixed with `iconHtml('chevronDown')` on both, matching the rotation the CSS was always built for.

## V3.40 — Juz Tracker, Phase 1 (free play) (2026-08-08)

**Files touched:** `index.html`, `js/icons.js`, `js/auth.js`, `js/app.js`, `js/kaabaTracker.js` (new), `css/juzTracker.css` (new), `js/sw.js`, `CHANGELOG.md`.

Full spec gathered over several rounds in chat before any code was touched, per the standing process rule. A new nav item + screen embeds the user-supplied `<kaaba-juz-tracker>` custom element (an isometric Kaaba cube, 30 clickable tiles mapped 1:1 to juz 1–30) exactly as uploaded, dropped in verbatim as `js/kaabaTracker.js`.

**Nav placement** — `NAV_ITEMS` (`js/auth.js`) already drives both the dropdown menu and the Home grid from one array (`renderNavItemsInto`), so one entry gives both surfaces automatically, same as every other item — placed between Progress and Settings. No student/teacher gating: confirmed in chat that the whole app is personal-to-user today and the Maktab/teacher phase hasn't started, so there's nothing to condition on yet.

**Icon** (`js/icons.js`) — no user-supplied SVG this round (the uploaded component's own art is full puzzle artwork, not nav-icon-sized), so this is Lucide's standard "box" icon adapted to a simple line cube, plus one short accent line for the kiswah band, matching the file's existing viewBox-only/stroke-only format.

**Free play behavior, confirmed in chat:** no `persist` attribute on the element, so nothing is ever written to localStorage or the backend — Phase 1 is a fully standalone toy. Progress resets whenever the app itself reloads, but stays put if you navigate to another screen and back within the same session (matches the component's own natural in-memory state — no extra reset logic needed). Amiri, which the component auto-loads from Google Fonts, was kept at its default.

**Sizing, added to scope mid-build:** the screen deliberately opts OUT of the app-wide 30%/50% max-width cap (`--width-tablet`/`--width-desktop`, tokens.css) that `#screen-admin`/`#screen-settings`/`.log-detail-card` use — the puzzle takes the full screen width at every breakpoint instead, bounded only by `#appContent`'s own existing padding and its 1400px cap at ≥1200px. `css/juzTracker.css` (new) adds top/left/right padding around the puzzle only, no bottom — best reading of how the request was phrased; flag if that's wrong. The component's own SVG already scales to 100% of its container width with `height:auto`, so no extra responsive CSS was needed for that part.

**`js/sw.js`, found while touching it for this release's own version bump:** its `ASSETS` list had fallen behind `index.html` — still missing `css/haidh.css`, `shared/haidhRules.js`, and `js/haidhDetailScreen.js` from V3.39. Brought back in sync and bumped to v3.40 along with this release's own new files. This service worker is still not registered anywhere (confirmed inert, same as before), so this was a no-behavior-change consistency fix, not a live bug fix.

---

## V3.39 — Haidh tracking (2026-08-07)

**Files touched:** `index.html`, `css/tokens.css`, `css/journal-table.css`, `css/haidh.css` (new), `js/icons.js`, `js/auth.js`, `js/app.js`, `js/settingsScreen.js`, `js/journal.js`, `js/haidhDetailScreen.js` (new), `shared/haidhRules.js` (new), `worker/src/attendance.js`, `worker/src/profile.js`, `worker/migrations/0018_haidh_ruling.sql` (new), `SCHEMA.md`.

Full spec worked out over several rounds in chat before any code was touched (per the standing "gather the full spec, wait for the explicit build phrase" process rule) — most of the backend groundwork turned out to already exist (the `attendance` table's `haidh`/`predicted-haidh` statuses, `handleGetAttendance`/`handleSetAttendance`/`handleDeleteAttendance`/`handlePredictHaidh`, `track_haidh`, `haidh_cycle_length`/`haidh_period_length`/`haidh_next_expected`), just never wired to any UI. This delivery is mostly wiring that up, plus two genuinely new pieces (the ruling selector, the two validation caps).

**Purpose, confirmed in chat after an initial wrong path (deleting logs on haidh days) was caught and corrected:** haidh tracking exists to account for days with no logs — in a Maktab/attendance context a haidh tag means the student isn't counted absent; in the personal diary, when measuring compliance against a logging plan, haidh days count as compliant even with nothing logged. **No log is ever deleted, and nothing on the Sabaq/Sabaq Dhor/Dhor detail cards changes** — haidh marking only ever touches the `attendance` table.

**Setup's Haidh section** (`index.html`, `js/settingsScreen.js`) gets three additions: a "Haaidha" checkbox (plain checkbox, `.cb-private-row` — same convention as the existing Confirm-selection/Private checkboxes elsewhere), writing straight to `track_haidh` via its own `apiSaveProfile` call the instant it's toggled — deliberately outside the section's own Save button (confirmed in chat: "will not require a separate save"), then immediately refreshing both nav surfaces (home grid + dropdown) so the new "Haidh" nav item appears without a reload. A Hanafi/Shafi'i ruling switch (same `switch-track`/`wireSwitch` component gender's switch already uses), defaulting to Hanafi when unset rather than blocking. And the two existing prediction fields relabeled for clarity — "Cycle length" → "Haidh cycle frequency", "Duration" → "How many haidh days per cycle".

**Two caps, both confirmed in chat over several rounds of sense-checking the actual numbers:** a continuous haidh run can't exceed the student's ruling (10 days Hanafi / 15 Shafi'i), and a new run can't start until 15 days have passed since the last one. Two subtleties that took real back-and-forth to pin down, both live in `shared/haidhRules.js` (loaded as a plain script for the frontend and a CommonJS module for the Worker, same dual-loading pattern `shared/data.js` already established, per CONVENTIONS.md's single-source-of-truth principle — Setup's client-side pre-check and the backend's real check use the exact same numbers, never two copies):
- The numbers actually enforced in code are offset by one calendar day from what's shown to the student (11/16 continuous days, 14-day gap instead of 15) — a clinically-N-day haidh can legitimately touch N+1 calendar dates when it starts or ends mid-day, so the code's boundary is deliberately one day looser than the spoken rule. The wording shown to the student never changes.
- "Haidh cycle frequency"'s real minimum isn't a flat 15 — cycle length stays the clinically-standard start-to-start definition, so the actual floor is `duration + 15`, computed per student (`haidhMinCycleFrequency`). Both the standalone range check AND this cross-field combination are validated at Setup-save time (`worker/src/profile.js`) — a 10-day duration with a 23-day frequency fails even though 10 and 23 each pass their own individual check, since the resulting gap (13 days) is short of 15.

**The Haidh calendar** (`js/haidhDetailScreen.js`, new screen `screen-haidhDetail`) — month-by-month paging rather than free scroll. Tapping an unmarked day marks it (a future date as `predicted-haidh`, today-or-past directly as `haidh`); tapping a marked day clears it. Predicted days render in a lighter shade (`--color-haidh-soft`) than confirmed ones, EXCEPT a predicted day that's already in the past renders full-shade — the auto-confirm rule ("not confirmed + no log = confirmed") is evaluated lazily/on the fly here, not via any stored state change or background job. The two caps are enforced server-side only; this screen just surfaces whatever error string comes back rather than duplicating the run/gap-scanning logic in two places. Reachable from the new "Haidh" nav item (shown only once `track_haidh` is true — no separate gender check needed, since a male student's `track_haidh` can never become true through the normal Setup UI) or from the journal (below).

**Journal integration** (`js/journal.js`) — a date with a haidh mark and nothing logged shows static text, "Haidh - log sabaq/dhor to cancel", in that row's Sabaq column only — no checkbox, no confirm/clear gesture (an earlier design with a tap-to-confirm/two-taps-to-clear checkbox was replaced with this simpler static version, confirmed in chat). Identical wording whether the day is still upcoming or already resolved — logging any entry, even backfilled after the date has passed, still cancels haidh for that day; there's no locked-in/final state. If ANY of the three log types exist for that date, haidh is cancelled outright and the row renders completely normally, no haidh mention anywhere. Attendance is fetched once per journal load, only for students with `track_haidh` set (skips a pointless call for everyone else).

**Icon** — the user-supplied Lucide `badge-alert` SVG, added to `js/icons.js` in this codebase's existing viewBox-only format (no baked-in width/height). Reused as-is at the two sizes already governed by existing CSS (`#homeGrid .nav-icon-item svg` at 36px for the nav tile, `.card-header-icon svg` at 22px for the calendar screen's own header) — no second icon file, no new sizing CSS needed.

**Color** — `--color-haidh`/`--color-haidh-soft` added to `css/tokens.css`, reusing the existing Mauve palette color rather than introducing a new raw hex (this file's own "every color is a variable" rule).

**Migration 0018** adds `haidh_ruling` (`hanafi`/`shafii`, `NOT NULL DEFAULT 'hanafi'`) — safe as a same-transaction default backfill, no separate data migration needed.

---

## V3.38 — IndoPak terminology picker and Surah baseline mode removed (2026-08-07)

**Files touched:** `index.html`, `css/settings.css`, `js/dhorPage.js`, `js/sabaqDhorPage.js`, `js/sabaqPage.js`, `js/settingsScreen.js`, `worker/src/profile.js`, `worker/src/dhorSchedule.js`, `worker/migrations/0017_drop_indopak_terminology_and_baseline_mode.sql` (new), `SCHEMA.md`.

Two features removed entirely, on hold, per the standing process rule (delete unused code promptly rather than leave it parked — no dependent users yet, so no back-compat risk):

**IndoPak's Maqra/Rub'/Hizb terminology picker** (confirmed in chat: "putting the hybrid build on hold"). Removed from the UI (`indopakTerminologyRow`, `index.html`), and from all 4 copies of `refForMushaf`/`refForMushafSabaqDhor`/`refForMushafSabaq` (`js/dhorPage.js`, `js/sabaqDhorPage.js`, `js/sabaqPage.js`, `js/settingsScreen.js`) — each drops its now-unused `indopakTerminology` parameter and the `mushaf==='15line_indopak' && indopakTerminology==='maqra_rub_hizb'` branch, back to the simple `mushaf==='15line_madani' ? 'uthmani' : 'waterval'`. IndoPak is Quarter/Half only now, same as 13-line, natively (unaffected by this: Madani's own Ru'b/Hizb terminology from V3.37, which never depended on this picker).

**Surah-based Hifz Setup history** (confirmed in chat: "History will only be collected as juz"). The Juz'/Surah switch (`section_grid_switch`) collapses to a single "Mark completed Juz" button (`css/settings.css`'s new `.settings-action-btn`, since `.switch-option` assumes a `.switch-track` parent and sliding thumb that no longer exist here) — `openSectionGridModal` drops its `mode` parameter entirely, `renderBaselineSummary` drops the Surah branch, `baselineMode` is gone as a concept. `worker/src/dhorSchedule.js`'s two `baseline_mode !== 'juz'` guards are removed as redundant — the `pool.length === 0` check right after each already covers "nothing set up," and Surah mode was never actually wired into Dhor Schedule generation to begin with (it always returned "no pool").

**Both DB columns dropped**, not just left unused (confirmed in chat: "let's do it properly and remove the columns") — `indopak_terminology` and `baseline_mode`, migration 0017. Both are safe to drop directly under SQLite 3.35.0+ (no table-rebuild needed): `indopak_terminology` has no constraint at all, and `baseline_mode`'s CHECK is inline/column-own, which SQLite drops along with the column. No real users yet, so this is a mechanical change, not a data migration — but deploy order still matters, since deploys here aren't atomic: **the code in this delivery must go live before migration 0017 runs**, not after, or the still-live old code will start erroring on every profile read/save the moment the columns are gone.

**Found and fixed while sweeping for dangling references** (not spotted until grepping the whole repo, not just the touched files): 3 call sites (`js/sabaqDhorPage.js`'s `moveRowToDhor`, `js/dhorPage.js`'s Dhor-save pool update, `js/sabaqPage.js`'s auto-move-to-Dhor) were still sending `baseline_mode: 'juz'` in their `apiSaveProfile` payloads — harmless once the backend stopped reading that field, but genuinely dead code, cleaned up. Also a dangling `#section_grid_switch` CSS selector (updated to `#openJuzGridBtn`) and the now-dead `.grid-surah` CSS rule (removed).

`SCHEMA.md` updated to match — both column rows removed/updated.

---

**Files touched:** `shared/data.js`, `js/position.js`, `js/dhorPage.js`, `js/sabaqDhorPage.js`, `js/sabaqPage.js`, `js/settingsScreen.js`, `js/journal.js`, `index.html`, `sw.js`.

**Sabaq Dhor row ordering** ("4321 for all", confirmed in chat): completed rows now read most-recent-first everywhere they appear -- the base Quarter/Rub' sort in `computeCurrentJuzRows`, the Maqra branch, the Half/Full merge (Second Half now processed before First Half), `computeLingeringRows`, and the leftover-unmerged-quarters fallback. Root mechanism: `computeSabaqDhorSections` already returns completed sections in descending order; the code was explicitly re-sorting them ascending before display -- that explicit re-sort (and its 3 counterparts) is what flipped. Caught and fixed a real bug while testing this directly: a standalone completed quarter next to a merged half (e.g. Q1+Q2 merged, Q3 standalone) was landing after the merge regardless of actual recency, since the original 2-pass shape ("process pairs, then push leftover singles") always pushed leftovers last. Rewritten as a single descending walk (4→1) that consumes both members of a pair together when it merges -- verified correct for every mix of merged/standalone quarters via direct testing, not just the common cases.

**Sabaq Dhor's Maqra/Rub' behavior** (confirmed in chat, from screenshots): Maqra only ever describes the ONE Rub' currently in progress -- it has no bearing on Dhor at all, and isn't a new merge concept. The moment that Rub' completes (both its Maqras done), it renders through the exact same, unchanged Quarter/Rub-level row logic every completed Quarter always used (same chevron rollup, same `canMoveToDhor` rule) -- not a parallel implementation. Concretely: `computeCurrentJuzRows`'s `'maqras'` branch now gets the normal Quarter/Rub-level sections first, renders every already-complete Rub' through a new shared `buildIndividualCompletedRows` helper (also used by the plain `'quarters'` branch -- one implementation, not two), and only breaks the CURRENT Rub' into its Maqra sub-rows. Verified end to end against both of the user's own worked examples (`Maqra 4, Maqra 3, Ru'b 1` and `Maqra 5, Rub 2, Rub 1`) via direct testing, exact match both times.

**Ru'b/Hizb terminology** (V3.37's original spec, TODO.md): Madani's Dhor switch, Sabaq Dhor's row labels, `describeDhorSegment`, `quarterUnitLabel`, and Plan Dhor's per-Juz' rows all now say "Ru'b"/"Hizb" instead of "Quarter"/"Half" whenever `ref==='uthmani'` -- confirmed spelling "Ru'b" (apostrophe after the U), not "Rub'". Hizb specifically drops the "Juz X" prefix entirely and uses a new standalone global 1-60 number (`shared/data.js`'s `globalHizbNumber`, `(juz-1)*2+halfIndex`) -- a real structural difference from Half's per-Juz' display, not a word-swap, confirmed in chat. Rub' stays per-Juz' like Quarter always was. New shared helpers `quarterUnitWord(ref)`/`globalHizbNumber(juz, halfIndex)` in `shared/data.js`, used by both `js/position.js` and `js/dhorPage.js` rather than each maintaining its own copy. **Flagged, not separately confirmed in chat:** the single-letter abbreviation used in condensed labels (`describeDhorSegment`/`quarterUnitLabel`) is "R" for Rub' (e.g. "Juz 4 R2"), matching the existing "Q"/"H" style -- easy one-line change if a different letter is wanted. This also finishes IndoPak's own Maqra/Rub'/Hizb picker option (V3.36) actually working as intended, since it shares the exact same `ref==='uthmani'` code paths Madani uses.

**Journal `isLatest` fix** (flagged since V3.36.1, confirmed separate from that bug): `journal.js`'s edit popup never determined whether an entry was the current frontier before opening it for editing, unlike the card's own History (which correctly passes `row === rows[0]`) -- `sabaqEditingIsFrontier` was always false for anything edited through Journal, so editing the actual most-recent Sabaq entry through Journal skipped the position-advance it should get. Fixed with a new `isLatestEntry(type, date, index)` helper -- checks the entry's date against the true most recent date (across all of `journalData`, not just within one day) that has any entry of that type, wired into both of Journal's edit entry points (the entries popup and the direct cell click).

**Documentation** (confirmed in chat -- "clearly not obvious"): expanded the `RUB_BOUNDARIES` comment in `shared/data.js` and all 4 `refForMushaf` copies to state explicitly that 15-line IndoPak genuinely shares Waterval's quarter/half/juz' data natively (ayah-position landmarks, not tied to page layout) -- not IndoPak defaulting/falling through to 13-line's data for lack of its own.

**File header versioning** (new standing convention, confirmed in chat): every file this delivery touches now carries a `Current as of V3.37` line in its header comment, alongside the existing historical prose (kept as-is, still useful design history) -- not yet applied retroactively to untouched files.

**Not addressed this delivery, deliberately:** the Dhor eligibility pool's ref-agnostic behavior on a mushaf switch -- resolved as a non-issue once traced (Dhor/the pool never resolve to actual ayahs at all, only abstract positions -- see TODO.md history).

---

Confirmed across several rounds of design discussion before any of this was built. Maqra becomes a new, finer level in Sabaq Dhor's "mark sections revised" rollup chain — but only when the Rub'/Hizb model is active (`ref='uthmani'`); the 13-line/IndoPak Quarter/Half/Full chain is completely untouched, still exactly the 3 levels it always was.

**Architecture**: Maqra isn't one more merge level layered on top of the existing quarter data — it's genuinely finer than the app's existing 4-per-Juz' quarter base unit (8 per Juz'), so it needed its own structural layer underneath, not a modification of the existing one. 3 new functions in `shared/data.js` (`studyMaqraIndex`, `structuralMaqraOf`, `structuralMaqraBounds`) mirror the existing quarter equivalents exactly, built on `RUB_BOUNDARIES.uthmani` (the 240-entry dataset, confirmed in V3.36.0 to actually be Maqra data) instead of the 4-per-Juz' quarter data. A new `computeSabaqDhorSectionsMaqra` in `js/position.js` mirrors `computeSabaqDhorSections` the same way. Sabaq Dhor's existing Quarter/Half/Full merge logic needed zero changes — it was already correctly built on true Rub' data (confirmed in the terminology-sourcing work), so Maqra simply became a new, separate finest level sitting underneath it, not something the existing chain needed to be rebuilt around.

**Behavior**: Maqra becomes the new default/base level whenever the Rub'/Hizb model is active — all 8 of the current Juz's Maqras shown (completed + current), the same pattern the existing quarter level already uses. The rollup stepper (chevron) now navigates a 4-level chain for Madani (Maqra → Quarter → Half → Full) instead of 3, generalized to step through the level list by index rather than hardcoded specific transitions, since the list's own length now genuinely differs by model. A stored rollup preference from a previous Rub'/Hizb session is validated against the current model before being trusted, rather than assumed still valid — Maqra has no Waterval equivalent, so a stale "Maqra" preference read while on 13-line would otherwise call Maqra-only functions for the wrong model entirely.

**Labels**: still "Maqra 1", "Maqra 2 (current)", etc. — plain English, not yet "Ru'b"/"Hizb" terminology. That relabeling is explicitly V3.37's own, separate work.

**Verified before considering this done**: Maqra 1+2 combined confirmed to exactly match Quarter 1's own span (both structurally and through the full row-computation pipeline, not just the isolated helper functions), Juz' 30's reverse study order confirmed correct for Maqra the same way it already was for Quarter, and Waterval's existing behavior re-confirmed completely unaffected by any of this.

## V3.36.2 — 13-line/IndoPak Juz' boundaries corrected, genuinely derived from the same source as the quarters (2026-08-06)

Confirmed by the user before this went anywhere near live code — `JUZ_BOUNDARIES` (the 13-line/IndoPak print's own Juz' start points) was previously a separately-sourced file, agreeing with the Waterval quarter data at 25 of 30 points, differing by a few ayahs each at Juz' 7, 14, 20, 21, 23. Worth being precise about the framing here, since it matters: this isn't fixing an error. Juz' divisions are a human convenience layered onto the Quran's own revealed surah/ayah boundaries, not something with one universally correct answer the way the text itself is — two independently-sourced files were never guaranteed to agree everywhere, and neither reading was "wrong."

What changed: `JUZ_BOUNDARIES` is now genuinely derived directly from `RUB_BOUNDARIES.waterval` itself — each Juz's own last quarter marker, one ayah past it — rather than a separate file that only happened to mostly agree with it. This keeps the 13-line/IndoPak model internally consistent with its own quarter data, the same way `QUARTER_BOUNDARIES_UTHMANI` was already correctly derived from the Uthmani Rub' data for Madani.

**Scope, traced before building**: `JUZ_BOUNDARIES` feeds 4 functions in `shared/data.js` — `getJuzForPosition`, `juzStartSurah`, `getJuzSurahSpan`, and `structuralQuarterBounds` (which in turn drives Sabaq Dhor's entire section/row computation). All 4 inherit the correction automatically through the same constant; no other code needed to change. Verified directly, not just assumed: `getJuzForPosition` and `structuralQuarterBounds` both confirmed to reflect the new boundary correctly at Juz' 7 specifically, before considering this done.

## V3.36.1 — Fixed: editing/splitting an older Sabaq entry could rewind real progress (2026-08-06)

A real, confirmed bug — not related to V3.36.0's own changes. Traced
through 2 rounds: an initial hypothesis (Journal's edit popup not
correctly determining whether an entry is the current frontier) turned
out to be a real, separate inconsistency worth fixing on its own, but
not the actual cause here — the user confirmed editing happened
through the card's own History, which already handles that correctly.
The real root cause was 3 layers down, in `advancePositionAfterSabaq`
itself (`js/position.js`).

**Root cause**: that function computes where the "frontier" (the
furthest point actually reached) now sits from a saved entry's own
From/To, then overwrote the stored position with it unconditionally —
correct for the normal case, where each new entry naturally continues
from the last, but wrong for a genuinely new entry covering an
already-passed range. Splitting a previously-logged range into 2
separate entries produces exactly that: at least one new entry for an
older piece of it. That entry's own save still goes through the same
unconditional path (it IS a new entry, not an edit to an existing
one), silently dragging the real frontier backward to match it even
though nothing about genuine progress moved.

**Fixed** by comparing the newly-computed frontier against the
position already stored before overwriting it — using the study
order (Juz' 30 first, backwards, then 29, then 1-28 ascending) for a
genuinely different Juz', and the same study-direction-aware
comparison already used elsewhere in this function for the same Juz'.
Only updates when the new frontier is genuinely further along than
what was already there; a backfill/split entry for an already-passed
range now correctly leaves the real frontier alone.

Verified directly against 6 scenarios before considering this done:
normal sequential progress still advances correctly, the exact bug
scenario (a backfill entry for an older range) no longer rewinds
anything, a genuine cross-Juz' advance still works, a student with no
prior position at all still gets their first entry accepted, and both
directions of Juz' 30's own reverse study order (a genuine advance,
and a backfill that shouldn't rewind) both resolve correctly.

## V3.36.0 — Hybrid removed, 15-line IndoPak mushaf built (2026-08-06)

Confirmed across many rounds of chat, alongside a full data-integrity
review of the user-supplied IndoPak page/line dataset before any of
this was built.

**Hybrid removed entirely.** Traced its actual behaviour rather than
trusting its UI label — its `ref` logic (`mushaf === '15line_madani'
? 'uthmani' : 'waterval'`) only ever recognized one specific value as
"use 15-line data"; Hybrid fell through to the same `waterval` branch
13-line uses. It never behaved differently from plain 13-line for
anything `ref` drove — same Juz' boundaries, same Lines/Pages numbers
— despite its own Settings description ("15 line pages with 13 line
quarter markings") describing a distinction that was never actually
wired in. Nothing real was lost removing it.

**New 15-line IndoPak mushaf**, replacing it as the third option.
Uses its own verified page/line dataset (`AYAH_LINE_INDOPAK`,
`shared/data.js`) for Sabaq's Lines/Pages — not Madina's, always,
regardless of any other choice made for this mushaf. The dataset
itself was independently verified before building anything on top of
it: exactly 6,236 rows (the Quran's real ayah count), zero duplicates,
every surah's ayah sequence contiguous and matching known counts, all
604 pages present with no gaps, and — the real test, given the two
15-line prints share page boundaries but differ in how ayahs
distribute across a page's lines — all 604 page boundaries cross-
checked against the already-verified Madina data and found to match
exactly.

**New picker, shown only when IndoPak is selected**: Quarter/Half (the
13-line convention) or Maqra/Rub'/Hizb (the Madani convention),
defaulting to Quarter/Half. Confirmed selectable now, even though the
real Maqra/Rub'/Hizb *display* system (relabeled terminology, derived
boundaries, Hizb's own global numbering) is V3.37's work — this
picker's second option borrows Madani's own existing Uthmani boundary
data in the meantime, so it's functionally real (correct underlying
Juz' boundaries) even though its labels stay in the older Quarter/Half
form until V3.37 lands.

**Architecture**: two genuinely separate concerns, kept deliberately
distinct rather than collapsed into one. Sabaq's Lines/Pages routing
(`pageRefForMushaf`) is a direct, unconditional mushaf → dataset
mapping — IndoPak always reads its own data here, full stop. Dhor/
Sabaq Dhor's own terminology routing (`refForMushaf` and its 3
duplicated copies, extended with a second parameter) is separate,
respecting the picker's choice — verified end to end that the two
resolve independently for every mushaf/terminology combination.

**Database**: new `indopak_terminology` column (migration 0016,
`quarter_half` / `maqra_rub_hizb` / NULL, only meaningful when mushaf
is IndoPak). No stored student currently has `mushaf = 'hybrid'`
(confirmed inactive beforehand), but the migration defensively
reassigns any that exist to `13line` rather than leaving a newly-
invalid value in place.

## V3.35.2 — Fixed: editing landed on the Timer instead of the card being edited (2026-08-05)

A real, long-standing bug, not related to V3.35.1's own changes — the
user had first noticed it during the Journal hold-to-edit work and
reasonably attributed it to that at the time, but it turned out to
predate it and sit underneath every edit path equally, regardless of
how editing was actually triggered.

**Root cause**: the CSS rule meant to hide every card except the one
being edited (`.log-detail-card:not(.editing-active) { display: none;
}`) only ever matched `.log-detail-card` — and `#dhorTimerHost` was
never a `.log-detail-card` at all. It's a separate custom element,
targeted everywhere else in this file by its own id, not that class —
so the rule genuinely could never reach it. That meant the Timer
stayed fully visible throughout editing on every one of the other 3
cards, still holding its own spot in the rail's layout, while the
actual intent had always been "every other card hides." With 2
elements visible instead of the intended 1 (the card being edited,
plus the still-present Timer), the rail could land on the wrong one —
matching exactly "click edit, land on the Timer, swipe back to reach
the actual edit."

**Fixed** by extending that same rule to also cover `#dhorTimerHost`
explicitly, so it's now genuinely hidden during editing the same way
the other 2 non-edited cards already were — nothing left visible in
the rail except the card actually being edited, regardless of which
of the 3 cards that is or which path opened editing.

## V3.35.1 — Sabaq Lines/Pages recompute-on-confirm, Journal popup + plain click, card height genuinely fills the screen (2026-08-05)

**Sabaq's Lines/Pages now recalculate when "Confirm selection" is
checked.** The existing auto-calculation only ever fired from one
narrow trigger — the "To" ayah field's own change event — silently
missing the stepper buttons, the surah picker, and the "From" field
entirely. Checking Confirm selection is the one moment guaranteed to
happen right before every save, so it's now the reliable point Lines/
Pages is recalculated from, regardless of which of those actually
built the range.

**Journal's "+N" badge is now a popup, not a dead end.** It's a real
button now, opening a small list of every entry for that date/type —
each individually tappable into its own edit, using the same
`.modal-overlay`/`.modal-card` pattern already used elsewhere (Plan
Dhor, History) rather than a new modal mechanism. Previously only the
most recent entry in a column was ever reachable; a day with 3 Sabaq
Dhor entries now makes all 3 reachable, not just 1.

**Journal's hold-to-edit is gone, replaced with a plain click** — both
touch and mouse, cells and the date cell alike. The `(hover: hover)
and (pointer: fine)` distinction is gone too, since there's nothing
left for touch and mouse to disagree on. Root cause this fixes:
`touch-action: none` (needed so a hold wasn't fought by the browser's
own scroll gesture) also blocked the browser's own ability to tell a
still-scrolling finger apart from a genuine tap — so an ordinary slow
scroll through the table could cross the hold's timing threshold and
trigger an unwanted navigation. A click has no timing window for a
scroll to fall into, so this is gone at the mechanism level, not
tuned around.

**`.log-detail-card` and `#dhorTimerHost` genuinely fill the screen**,
replacing a flat, hardcoded `70vh`/`75vh` that left real, substantial
empty space below every card and stranded edit-mode's own bottom
controls partway down the screen. Two calculated standards, confirmed
in chat as a pattern to reuse for anything built going forward:
- **Normal** (dots row visible): `100vh` minus the auth band minus the
  dots row (~36px, worked out directly from the `.dot` button's own
  padding/font/border plus its row's margin).
- **No dots row present** (`.editing-active`, and desktop's grid layout
  at 1180px+, where the dots row is hidden entirely either way — all 4
  cards already visible, nothing to indicate a position within):
  `100vh` minus just the auth band.

`#dhorTimerHost` needed its own matching rule, not something the
`.log-detail-card` fix reached automatically — it's a separate custom
element with its own previously-duplicated `70vh`/`75vh` values, not
something that shares the class at all.

## V3.35.0 — Journal landing page: complete rebuild (2026-08-05)

Confirmed across many rounds of chat. The largest single change to
this screen since it was first built — genuinely a rebuild, not a
revision, once it became clear `js/journal.js` hadn't been touched
since its very first version and was reading fields (`e.surah`,
`e.ayah_from`, `e.ayah_to`) that haven't existed since the verse-ref
rework — silently showing "—" for every real Sabaq entry the whole
time this went unnoticed.

**Table:**
- Feedback column removed.
- Shorthand per type, reusing the exact same data History's own
  `describeEntryForRail` already reads, trimmed down: Sabaq (range
  only, no lines/pages), Sabaq Dhor (range only, no mistakes), Dhor
  (segment only, no mistakes/time).
- Latest date at the top.
- Most recent 10 days shown individually; older data rolled into
  weekly (rolling 7-day, not calendar-week) rows showing just the date
  range — deliberately no attempt to summarize several different
  entries across several days in one line, confirmed as either too
  crowded or too vague to be worth reading. ~3 months loads by
  default; a "Load more" row extends the rollup range further back in
  28-day increments.
- The old "quick add" modal is gone entirely — it was a separate,
  much simpler form that didn't match any card's real current fields
  (no tajweed, no Notes, no Juz'/Amount picker). Editing now opens the
  real card directly via the exact same `EDIT_HANDLERS` entry point
  History's own edit button already uses — one edit mechanism, not two.

**Interaction:**
- Mouse/trackpad (`(hover: hover) and (pointer: fine)`, not inferred
  from screen width, since a touchscreen laptop at desktop width is
  still touch): a plain click opens an entry for editing.
- Touch: press-and-hold (450ms, 8px cancel-on-movement), same target —
  cells are plain text now, not selectable/editable directly
  (`touch-action`/`user-select: none`), so there's no native
  edit-field UI to compete with the way the timer pill's drag once did.
- Date cell: same interaction, sets every card's own date field to the
  tapped date and opens the detail screen — so a new entry logged from
  there is dated correctly, not date-filtered browsing (History's own
  rail already covers that).

**Fixed a real bug found while diagnosing "every column goes to the
Sabaq card"**: `exitEditScreenMode` was unconditionally restoring the
rail's scroll position every time it ran — including the 3 non-edit
"fresh open" calls each card's own render function makes on every
single detail-screen open, whether or not anything was actually being
edited. All 3 running back to back meant whichever finished last
always won, silently overriding wherever a column-header tap (or any
other entry point) was actually trying to scroll to. Now only restores
scroll position when the screen was genuinely in edit mode — a normal
fresh open never had a corrupted position to begin with, so it's left
alone, and the intended destination actually sticks now. Confirmed:
desktop's static grid needs no equivalent fix (nothing to scroll to
begin with); mobile and tablet share the same rail mechanism, so one
fix covers both.

**Nav:** the 3 placeholder items (Sabaq/Sabaq Dhor/Dhor — all 3 already
lived together on the detail screen, redundant as separate entries)
removed. One new entry added for the detail screen itself, using the
user-supplied icon.

**Layout:** header no longer rides along via `position: sticky` as the
whole page scrolls — sits fixed above a bounded, independently-
scrolling rows region instead, closer to a spreadsheet's frozen header
than a sticky one. Header made a precise 20% taller (36px vs. the
previous 30px, not an eyeballed guess).

**Verified, not just read over**: ran the actual weekly-rollup
bucketing algorithm directly against a realistic set of scattered
dates with gaps, confirming rolling 7-day windows group and split
correctly. Swept the whole codebase for dangling references to the
removed quick-add mechanism and confirmed every global the new code
relies on (`EDIT_HANDLERS`, `describeDhorSegment`, `dhorCurrentRef`)
genuinely exists and is accessible.

## V3.34.13 — Confirmation checkboxes repositioned higher on both cards (2026-08-05)

Confirmed in chat: both "Confirm selection" checkboxes (V3.34.12) moved
from the bottom of their cards (next to the error div they trigger) to
higher up, left-aligned with the rest of each card's own content, no
new indentation or centering. Sabaq's now sits directly under Sabaq
History, right before the "Sabaq from" label. Dhor's now sits directly
under the Quarter/Half/Full portion selector, right before the Juz row.
Pure markup relocation — same element ids, same `js/sabaqPage.js`/
`js/dhorPage.js` logic, same `.cb-private-row` styling (already
left-aligned by default) — nothing else about how either checkbox
behaves changed.

## V3.34.12 — Pill-width drag fix, and a new confirmation checkbox on Sabaq/Dhor (2026-08-05)

Three pieces, confirmed together in chat as one bundled delivery.

**Fixed: the mini pill stretched into a full-width band once dragged**,
reported specifically on mobile. Root cause: `.mini`'s own `width: 100%`
means "100% of the space the flexbox gives it" while it's a normal flex
child — correct, and capped sensibly by its `max-width: 420px`. The
instant a drag switches it to `position: fixed`, `100%` means something
different: 100% of the actual viewport, since a fixed element measures
against that instead. On a phone narrower than 420px, the screen is
already smaller than that cap, so the cap never gets a chance to catch
it — exactly why this only showed up as a band on mobile specifically.
Fixed by capturing and locking in the pill's own already-correct width
the moment before switching it to `position: fixed`, so it carries its
real shape into the drag instead of recalculating against the wrong
reference.

**New confirmation checkbox on both Sabaq and Dhor** — "Confirm
selection," hard-blocking Save exactly the way Sabaq Dhor's own "mark
sections revised" checkboxes already do (an error message, no save
going through, until checked), rather than the softer yes/no prompt
the earlier "nothing entered" check used. Confirmed in chat: replaces
that "nothing entered" `confirm()` on both cards entirely, not layered
alongside it — and applies to every save, new entries and edits alike
(the earlier check on Dhor specifically only applied to new entries;
this one is a genuine, deliberate confirmation of whatever the current
selection is, which matters just as much when editing). Clears itself
immediately after every successful save on both cards, matching Sabaq
Dhor's own already-fixed behavior (V3.34.3) — a fresh confirmation is
required each time, not one that lingers checked from a previous save.

## V3.34.11 — Drag now starts from a dedicated handle, not press-and-hold (2026-08-05)

Confirmed in chat: V3.34.10's press-and-hold-anywhere approach leaked
its gesture through to whatever was visually underneath the pill — the
device's own native long-press (text selection, a context menu) had
enough of a window during the 450ms hold to fire alongside the custom
timer, and reach through to the screen behind it. `pointer-events` on
the pill doesn't block a lower-level, OS-adjacent gesture like that.

**Replaced entirely with a dedicated drag handle** — a small move icon,
leftmost in the pill's top row (Close/Reset/Note Time/Maximise keep
their existing order after it). Touching down on just that one small
area starts the drag immediately, with no hold duration at all — there
was never a native-gesture window for the timer to compete with in the
first place, since the interaction is resolved the instant it begins
rather than after a delay. Everywhere else on the pill goes back to
plain, ordinary tap behavior.

All the hold-timing and movement-cancel-threshold logic from V3.34.10
is gone — there's no longer any ambiguity between "this is a tap" and
"this is a drag" to resolve, so nothing needs to wait and watch for it.
`touch-action: none` moved from the whole pill down to just the handle
itself, since the rest of the pill no longer needs it. The actual drag
mechanics underneath (live tracking, on-screen clamping, session-only
memory of where it was left) are unchanged from V3.34.10 — only how the
drag is triggered changed.

## V3.34.10 — Mini pill is now genuinely draggable (2026-08-05)

Scope changed in chat: from "fix the pill's fixed position" to "the
pill moves wherever you put it." Confirmed 3 specific decisions before
building, since each one changes how the interaction actually works:

**Press-and-hold anywhere on the pill starts a drag** — not a
dedicated handle. A plain tap still reaches the buttons underneath
normally; only a genuine hold (450ms, cancelled if the pointer moves
more than 8px before that elapses, so an accidental brush or scroll
attempt doesn't accidentally start dragging) engages it. A drag that
just ended suppresses its own trailing click, so releasing a hold never
also fires whatever button happened to be under the pointer.

**Default starting position moved to the top of the screen** (was the
bottom, from the earlier fixed-position work) — the CSS host wrapper's
`align-items` flipped from `flex-end` to `flex-start`, safe-area
padding flipped to the top edge accordingly.

**Position is remembered for the current session only** — a plain
instance field on the component (`this._dragLeft`/`_dragTop`), not
written anywhere persistent, so it resets to the default top-center
spot on a fresh page load but correctly returns to wherever it was
dragged to on every re-minimise within the same session (maximise,
navigate elsewhere, come back — the dragged position holds).

**Constrained to stay fully on-screen**, continuously during the drag
itself and also re-clamped on window resize/rotation afterward — a
drag that ended near an edge shouldn't be able to end up partially
off-screen just because the viewport later changes shape.

**Verified, not just read over**: ran the exact clamping formula used
by both the live drag and the resize handler against normal,
past-edge, negative, and viewport-shrink cases directly.

## V3.34.9 — Mini pill's positioning bug actually fixed at its root, not worked around (2026-08-05)

Prompted by a genuinely good question in chat: why did History/Plan
Dhor's own bottom-anchored sheets never hit this bug at all?

**Answer, and it changed the fix entirely**: `.modal-overlay`
(`css/components.css`) has never anchored via `bottom:` at all. It's
`position: fixed; inset: 0` (all 4 edges simultaneously) with
`align-items: flex-end` pushing its sheet to the bottom via flexbox —
letting the browser's own layout engine determine where "the bottom"
actually is, rather than calculating that one edge independently. iOS
Safari's toolbar bug specifically affects single-edge `bottom:`
calculations; a fully-`inset: 0` container was never touching that
code path in the first place.

V3.34.8's `bottom: 20px` anchoring on the pill directly was exactly the
pattern the bug affects, and the `window.visualViewport` fix built on
top of it was a workaround for that mechanism, not a fix of it — and it
applied unconditionally, including on desktop where the bug doesn't
exist, which is why the previous position regressed there.

**This version applies the same `inset: 0` + flexbox technique the
modals already use successfully**, instead: the timer host becomes a
full-viewport, invisible (`:host([mode="mini"])` was already
`background: transparent`) positioning wrapper when minimised — the
same shape `.modal-overlay` already is — with `pointer-events: none` so
it doesn't intercept taps anywhere except where the pill itself
actually sits (re-enabled via `pointer-events: auto` on the pill's own
`.mini` div). No JavaScript, no `visualViewport`, no `MutationObserver`
— all removed entirely, not adjusted.

**Confirmed in chat**: when History or Plan Dhor opens while the timer
is minimised, both are now the same underlying shape (`inset: 0` +
flexbox), so `.modal-overlay`'s existing `z-index: 300` against the
pill's `250` means the modal's sheet covers the pill for as long as
it's open — the timer keeps running underneath, completely unaffected,
and the pill reappears exactly where it was once the modal closes.
Confirmed as the wanted behavior over giving the pill priority instead.

## V3.34.8 — Full view resized for mobile, mini pill repositioned around a genuine iOS Safari bug (2026-08-04)

Confirmed in chat, sized specifically against a 390×844 (6.1") viewport.

**Full view resized to actually fit its allotted space.** The ring was
a fixed 300px regardless of available height — the real cause of the
clipping reported, not a padding problem padding alone could have
closed. Worked the numbers out directly: 70vh of an 844px screen leaves
~591px for the whole card, minus the view's own padding leaves ~543px
of real content space. Ring now `min(210px, 25vh)` (was a flat 300px —
scales down further on anything shorter than the 6.1" target rather
than staying fixed), the round Start/Stop controls 72px (was 96px), and
padding trimmed throughout — lands at roughly 453px total, leaving
~90px of genuine margin rather than a bare fit.

**Mini pill repositioned around a real, currently-open Apple bug, not
just a CSS tweak.** Researched this rather than assuming a quick CSS
fix would hold: iOS Safari's own developer forums document `position:
fixed` content getting clipped near the bottom edge (not just hidden
behind the toolbar) as of iOS 26 specifically, when the toolbar is
showing. No CSS-only approach reliably solves this across iOS versions.
The actual fix uses `window.visualViewport` to read the real,
currently-visible area directly and position the pill against that —
covers the devices actually affected; `detail-pages.css`'s existing
bottom-anchoring rule remains the fallback for anything without
`visualViewport` support. Watched via a `MutationObserver` on the
timer's own `mode` attribute rather than needing a matching call at
every place `mode` might change to `'mini'` — catches the component's
own internal Minimise action the same as anything triggered from here.

**Floating means fixed-position overlay, not draggable** — confirmed
directly with the user last round; no change needed, since that's
already what's built.

**Verified, not just read over**: ran the actual repositioning function
against a shrunk visible-viewport height (simulating the toolbar being
visible), a scrolled offset, and confirmed it correctly clears its own
inline styles rather than leaving them behind when the timer isn't
minimised or `visualViewport` isn't available.

## V3.34.7 — Fixed: Timer card was invisible on every screen load (2026-08-04)

Root cause of the "Timer card missing" issue reported across several
rounds — confirmed via a live DOM inspection, since the static HTML and
every deployed file checked out clean the whole time.

**`renderDhorScreen` still contained `if(timerHost.elapsed === 0)
timerHost.classList.add('hidden');`** — logic that made sense before
V3.34.5, when the timer needed to hide itself by default on a fresh
screen-open. Once the timer became a permanent rail card, this line
became actively wrong: `renderDhorScreen` runs every single time the
day-log screen opens, and a fresh timer's elapsed time is always 0 — so
it was re-hiding the timer immediately on every load, regardless of what
the deployed HTML or scripts actually said. This is why checking the
GitHub source, the deployed script versions, and the zip all came back
clean: none of them were wrong. The bug was runtime behavior inside a
function that ran after every page load, invisible to anything that
only inspects source or file versions — only a live DOM inspection
during the session actually caught it.

Removed the line entirely and swept the rest of the codebase for
anything similar targeting the timer — confirmed nothing else does.

## V3.34.6 — Rail scroll position fixed after editing; Duration split into 2 numeric fields (2026-08-04)

**Fixed: editing a Sabaq Dhor or Dhor entry from History returned to the
Sabaq card afterward, not the card actually being edited.** Root cause:
during editing, every card except the one being edited is `display:
none`'d (an existing rule), which collapses the rail's scrollable width
down to just that single card — so its scroll position is effectively 0
throughout. Once editing finishes and the other cards reappear, that
stale 0 now points at Sabaq (the first card), regardless of which card
was actually being edited — invisible when editing from Sabaq itself,
since 0 already happens to be correct there, which is exactly why this
only showed up on the other two. `exitEditScreenMode` now explicitly
restores the rail's scroll position to the edited card before handing
control back.

**Duration split into 2 plain number fields (Minutes/Seconds) instead
of 1 text field holding "mm:ss".** Confirmed in chat after a real
back-and-forth on the actual mechanism: a colon in the middle of a
single field doesn't suit the native numeric keypad, which expects
plain digits — so each field being purely numeric lets the keypad work
exactly as designed for both. Typing a 2nd digit into Minutes (capped
at 2, so max 99) auto-advances straight into Seconds; leaving Minutes
with just 1 digit when focus moves away — by any means: iOS's
checkmark, Android's Next, tapping Seconds directly, or tapping away
entirely — defaults Seconds to 00, so a single-digit minute value never
needs its own explicit "00" typed out. `parseDhorDuration` is retired
entirely (its one and only caller was the field this replaces); Duration
now flows through 2 new helpers, `getDhorDurationSeconds`/
`setDhorDurationFields`, threaded through all 9 places the old single
field was read or written — the timer's own auto-fill, the raw-range
disable/enable toggle, edit-load, the "nothing entered" check, and the
form resets.

**Verified, not just read over**: ran the actual helpers against a real
split-and-reassemble round trip, the both-empty case, and the exact
typing sequences described in chat — 1 digit not auto-advancing, 2
digits advancing, and the blur-default filling Seconds with "00" only
when it's still genuinely empty.

## V3.34.5 — Rail restructured: Timer is now a permanent card, Tadabbur has its own screen (2026-08-04)

The largest single restructuring of this screen since the original
unified day-log view (V3.6.1) — confirmed in chat.

**Tadabbur moved out of the rail entirely, into its own standalone
nav destination.** Reused the existing `'reflections'` nav item rather
than adding a duplicate — it turned out to already be defined (`js/
auth.js`'s `NAV_ITEMS`), just never built out, sitting behind the
generic "coming soon" placeholder the whole time. Renamed its label
from "Reflections" to "Tadabbur" to match the app's own consistent
terminology everywhere else. `js/reflectionCard.js`'s own read/save
logic needed no changes at all — it only ever operated on element ids,
never anything about the rail itself.

**The Timer takes Tadabbur's old slot as the rail's permanent 4th
card.** No longer an on-demand overlay toggled by a hidden/visible
class — it's simply always there, like Sabaq/Sabaq Dhor/Dhor,
positioned via the same swipe/scroll-snap mechanism and sharing its
own dot indicator (relabeled from "Tadabbur" to "Timer"). The Dhor
card's Stopwatch button and the pill's Maximise action now scroll the
rail to it (the same `scrollTo`/`offsetLeft` mechanism the dot
indicators already used) instead of un-hiding an overlay. Built this
to navigate to the logDetail screen first only when not already there
— calling its full render unconditionally on every Maximise tap would
have discarded any unsaved, in-progress work on Sabaq/Sabaq Dhor/Dhor
just from opening the timer elsewhere in the app.

**Close no longer hides anything** — confirmed, since there's nothing
left to hide now that the timer is a permanent card; it simply resets
and sits there, the same as any other card would after a save.

**Minimise/Maximise are unchanged in spirit, confirmed explicitly**:
the mini pill is still a genuine `position: fixed` floating element,
independent of the rail entirely, so a running session still stays
visible over whatever screen is showing — this was never actually
tied to the overlay model that just got removed.

**A real sizing risk found and fixed along the way**: the component's
own `min-height: 640px` could have forced the card taller than its
newly-allotted 70–75vh rail space on a shorter screen. Removed it,
added `overflow: auto` as a safety net.

## V3.34.4 — Timer pill layout finalised: Maximise repositioned, row order fixed, lap dots, mobile safe-area (2026-08-04)

Confirmed in chat — the last of the pill's own layout details.

**Maximise moved into the top row**, rightmost of the 4 icons (Close,
Reset, Note Time, Maximise) — was in the second row before.

**Second row reordered**: Pause/Restart toggle on the left, elapsed time
centered in the middle, Lap on the right — was time-left/lap-middle/
toggle-right/maximise-far-right before.

**A small white dot now appears under Lap for every lap actually
recorded** — 3 laps means 3 dots, not just one indicator meaning "at
least one." Tested the exact rendering logic directly: 0 laps produces
no dots, 3 laps produces exactly 3.

**Full-screen mode now respects the device's own safe-area insets**
(status bar, home indicator) instead of claiming the literal 100% of
the viewport — this is what was actually causing controls to overlap
mobile indicators; the earlier tablet/desktop width cap (V3.34.2) was a
separate, different gap on larger screens and didn't touch this.

## V3.34.3 — Auto-repopulate after Dhor save, "nothing entered" confirmation, Sabaq same-ayah prepopulation, Sabaq Dhor duplicate-save fix (2026-08-04)

**Sabaq Dhor's checkboxes never cleared after a save** — found by the
user before this delivery went out, holding it back rather than
uploading a version with a live duplicate-save risk in it. The exact
same "mark sections revised" boxes stayed checked after saving, so
tapping Save a second time (an accidental double-tap, or simply not
noticing the first one had gone through) would recompute the identical
range and log a genuine duplicate. Fixed by reusing
`renderSabaqDhorScreen`'s own existing fresh-open logic — it already
rebuilds every row from scratch on each real open
(`rebuildRowsFromPosition`, reflecting the student's current position/
pool, which may well have just changed if this very save triggered a
Dhor-transition), so the checkboxes come back genuinely unchecked as a
natural side effect of that rebuild, not a second, separately-maintained
reset that could drift out of sync with what a real fresh open does —
same underlying pattern as this version's own Dhor auto-repopulate fix.

**After every Dhor save, the card clears and immediately repopulates
with the next queue item** — reuses `renderDhorScreen`'s own existing
fresh-open logic directly rather than a second, partial version of the
same reset, so the student can keep logging consecutive sessions without
navigating away and back each time.

**"Nothing entered" confirmation, Dhor and Sabaq.** Confirmed in chat
after discussing (and correctly ruling out) comparing against the last
saved entry — that approach wouldn't actually have caught an accidental
blank save, since Dhor's segment always legitimately differs from the
last entry as the queue advances, so "same as last time" is never true
even for a normal working save. What actually distinguishes an
accidentally-saved default form from a real session: Duration/Lines-
Pages, Mistakes, tajweed tags, and Notes are all still sitting at their
just-populated defaults. When every one of those is still empty/zero at
Save time, a confirmation now appears before proceeding — for new
entries only; editing an existing entry is always modifying real,
already-logged data, not risking this scenario. Sabaq Dhor doesn't get
this check: it already hard-blocks saving with nothing checked ("please
check at least one section"), a stronger existing protection for the
same underlying concern, not something to duplicate.

**Sabaq's From and To now prepopulate with the same starting ayah**,
instead of one field prepopulating and the other staying blank/dashed
(which field used to depend on juz' 30's backwards study direction vs.
every other juz' ascending) — `nextSabaqDefaults` (js/position.js)
simplified accordingly, one fewer branch than before.

**Verified, not just read over**: ran the actual nothing-entered check
against a genuinely blank form and against each field individually
being the only one filled in, confirming each real entry correctly
prevents the confirmation from firing.

## V3.34.2 — Timer icon semantics redefined, card-level lap rollup, responsive width cap (2026-08-04)

Confirmed in chat across several rounds — the largest single change to
the timer since it was first integrated.

**Close and Reset now do genuinely different things than they did
before.** Close used to minimise; now it stops the clock and discards
the session entirely (no save, nothing kept) — minimising is now its
own dedicated icon, since the pill's body is no longer one big "tap
anywhere to expand" surface (it holds its own controls now, see below),
so a single explicit tap target for going small was needed either way.
Reset used to zero the count while leaving a running timer still
ticking from 0 — confirmed this should stop it too, waiting for a
deliberate Start; the supplied component's own `reset()` left
`_running` untouched, so this required a real (small) change to its
internals, not just relabeling a button.

**"Save" is now "Note Time"**, re-iconed with the user-supplied
clipboard-clock SVG — same underlying action and same `timer-save`
event name the host app listens for, just a different face on it,
reflecting that this records a duration rather than saving a document.
Tapping it now asks for confirmation every time, full view or pill —
Cancel leaves everything exactly as it was; OK transfers elapsed/laps
into the card the same way it always has.

**Mini pill rebuilt entirely**, no longer a single button: a row of 3
small icons (Close/Reset/Note Time) above a second row (elapsed time,
Lap, Pause/Restart toggle, Maximise). Both the full view's big round
toggle and the pill's own small one share `data-act="toggle"` now, so
`_paint()` updates both together rather than just the first match a
plain `querySelector` would have found.

**New lap-times rollup on the Dhor card itself**, next to the Timer
button — shows what Note Time captured, collapsible, staying visible
until the Dhor entry is actually saved (at which point History becomes
the record of it instead, and the rollup clears). Wired into every
existing place `dhorLapTimes` already got reset, plus the actual save
success path, which didn't clear it before.

**Full-screen mode capped to the same width every other single-screen
element in the app already respects** — `--width-tablet`/`--width-
desktop`, same breakpoints, not new values invented for the timer.
This was the real gap behind an earlier full-screen complaint: the
immediate symptom that prompted it turned out to be a missing deployed
file (a blank overlay with nothing rendered, not a design choice), but
the underlying width issue was real and independent of that, and is
fixed here.

**Verified, not just read over**: confirmed `reset()`'s new
`_running = false` is actually present in the rewritten source, and ran
the new rollup function against both the empty and populated cases,
confirming visibility toggling and exact formatted lap lines.

## V3.34.1 — Timer's target linked to the real Setup value (2026-08-04)

Confirmed in chat: V3.34.0 briefly hardcoded the timer's per-session
target at 40 minutes, flagged at the time as an unconfirmed guess. There
was a real, live Setup field this should have read from instead —
"Minutes / juz'" (`target_minutes_per_juz`, defaulting to 40 there too,
which is why nothing visibly changes for a student who's never touched
it). The Stopwatch button's click handler now fetches the profile and
reads that value before opening the timer, scaling it by the card's
current Amount/Unit selection the same way as before — a student who's
set their own target to, say, 60 minutes/juz' now actually sees 30 for
a half, not a fixed 20.

Also confirmed in chat: the floating mini pill persisting across every
screen (not just while the Dhor card is showing) is the intended
behavior, not something to narrow — "if it's running it should be
visible everywhere." No code change needed for that; it already worked
this way as a side effect of the pill living outside the screen-toggling
mechanism entirely, confirmed by tracing `showScreen` directly.

## V3.34.0 — Dhor's timer replaced with the supplied session-timer component (items 1-4 of 5; item 5, mini-pill lap/stop controls, deferred to a later round) (2026-08-04)

**Old `js/timer.js` (Start/Lap/Stop, inline panel) removed entirely**,
replaced with the user-supplied `js/session-timer.js` — a self-contained
custom element (`<session-timer>`), adapted with "Start Dhor"/"Stop Dhor"
text labels added beneath its two round control buttons (everything
else in the supplied file is untouched).

**Structural change, not just a swap**: the old timer was an inline panel
inside the card, toggled open/closed, re-created every time the Dhor
screen opened. The new one is a single persistent element living outside
any one card — full-screen when active (matching the app's existing
modal z-index), repositioned to a bottom-floating pill via CSS when its
own "mini" mode is active. Its "Close" action minimises to that pill
rather than dismissing outright, since the point of the mini pill is a
running session that survives navigation rather than one that gets
thrown away — confirmed this is what "minimise... rather than blocking
the rest of the form" (specified for this feature well before this
component existed) actually meant. Re-opening the Dhor screen no longer
resets an in-progress session either: it only ensures the timer is
hidden if nothing's actually running, so switching tabs and coming back
doesn't lose a session someone's mid-way through — deferring item 5 to a
later round doesn't mean an active timer is fragile in the meantime.

**Save wired into the existing fields, not a new pipeline**: `dhor_log`
already had `duration_seconds`/`lap_times` fully wired end to end
(save, edit, validation) — the only new work was on `timer-save`,
converting the component's elapsed/laps (milliseconds) into the same
`dhor_duration_minutes` field and `dhorLapTimes` variable the save
payload already reads from.

**Laps now display in History** — confirmed this didn't exist anywhere
before (lap_times was saved but never shown): each Dhor history row
with recorded laps now lists them beneath its existing summary line.

**Target for the ring** (Claude's own choice this round, flagged since
it wasn't specified): reuses the existing "40 min per juz'" default from
the not-yet-built Dhor rings spec, scaled by the card's current
Half/Quarter/Full selection — the only established "how long should
this take" concept anywhere in the app, so it seemed the more grounded
choice than inventing a new number. Worth confirming.

**Verified, not just read over**: ran the actual target-minutes mapping
and the save handler's exact data-conversion logic (milliseconds to
whole seconds, for both the total and each individual lap) — confirmed
correct rounding and confirmed every lap value produced would pass the
backend's own existing validation (non-negative integers).

## V3.33.0 — Plan Dhor's vertical compression fixed at its actual root: a flex-shrink gotcha (2026-08-04)

Found via the user's own DevTools experiment, isolating viewport height
as the real variable rather than which tab was selected — a genuinely
useful diagnostic that led straight to the actual mechanism, after two
earlier rounds patched the wrong layer (text centering, then a long
label) without touching the real cause underneath.

**The modal is a vertical flex column (title row, switch, content list)
capped at 85% of the viewport's height.** `.plan-dhor-content` already
had `flex:1; overflow-y:auto` — the clear original intent was for the
list to be the one part that scrolls internally once content exceeds
that cap. But without `flex-shrink:0` on its siblings, every flex child
shrinks by default to help make room when things don't fit — so the
title row, the switch, and the Select All button were all shrinking too,
proportional to how much the list overflowed. "View All" (30 rows)
squeezed things far more than "Dhor Plan" (a handful of rows) because
there was more overflow to make room for, not because of anything about
which tab was active per se. A shorter browser viewport made it worse
for the same reason: 85% of a smaller number is a smaller number.

Fixed by giving the title row, the switch, and Select All `flex-shrink:
0` — only the content list absorbs overflow now, by scrolling
internally the way it always could, while everything above it holds its
real size regardless of how long the list underneath it gets.

## V3.32.0 — Plan Dhor: granularity-aware rollup labels, pill-tracking bug fixed, View All Completed removed, switch centering fixed (2026-08-04)

**Rollup labels now match the actual granularity a batch is built from,
not always quarter language.** `planDhorDaySummaryLabel` used to describe
every rollup row's first-to-last span in quarter terms ("Q1"/"Q4")
regardless of what granularity the batch actually was — so a half-juz'
batch (what most Setup configurations, halves not quarters, actually
produce) was being described with quarter positions that were never
really there. Now reuses `describeDhorSegment` (the same "Juz 2 H1" style
already used everywhere else on the card) for each boundary, matching
whatever granularity that specific batch is. Still collapses to the
plain "Juz 29 to Juz 30" form, but only when a batch genuinely runs from
the very start to the very end of those juz' — checked by quarter-unit
position, independent of the granularity in between. Verified directly:
a whole-juz' span still simplifies correctly, a half-juz' batch that
doesn't end on a juz' boundary now shows "Juz 2 H1 to Juz 3 H1" instead
of quarter language, and a single full juz' shows just "Juz 2."

**The tab switch's pill genuinely wasn't tracking selection — confirmed
and fixed.** Tapping a tab updated `planDhorTab` and redrew the content
below it, but the switch's own visual state (pill position, which option
is marked active) was only ever computed once, at modal-open time — the
tab-change handler never re-ran it. Now it does.

**"View All Completed" removed entirely** — confirmed redundant: "View
All" already showed everything it did, just with incomplete portions
greyed out rather than hidden. Frontend down to 2 tabs; the two
now-single-branch ternaries in `renderPlanDhorTabContent`/
`planDhorSelectAll` simplified to their one remaining case, and a
resulting unreachable "nothing marked complete" check removed.

**Vertical compression — fixed at the actual cause, not just by removing
the crowded label.** `.switch-option` (used by every switch in the app,
not just this one) had no vertical centering of its own; text sat on
whatever baseline a bare button defaults to inside a fixed-height,
overflow-hidden track. Added explicit `display:flex; align-items:center;
justify-content:center` so this can't happen again on any switch, on any
future long label, not just resolved incidentally by having fewer tabs.

## V3.31.0 — Unified spacing/sizing system across all 3 detail cards; date-display bug fixed at its root (2026-08-04)

Confirmed in chat: rather than patching one row at a time again, this
consolidates every card's spacing and sizing onto one shared system, plus
fixes the date display bug this round's screenshot caught.

**The date display bug — root cause was a fundamental DOM behavior, not
a logic error.** Every page sets its date field with a plain
`input.value = todayISO()` assignment (or `entry.date`, when loading an
entry for edit) — a plain assignment never fires a `change` event, full
stop, regardless of what code does the assigning. V3.30.0's display only
re-rendered on wiring (when the field was still empty) and on `change`,
so it never saw any of these later assignments and stayed stuck on
"Select date." Fixed by overriding the input's own `value` property
(`Object.defineProperty` against the real `HTMLInputElement.prototype`
descriptor) so *any* assignment — from the native picker or from any
page's own render code, present or future — re-renders the display
automatically, rather than requiring every call site to be found and
updated individually.

**One shared row-height variable for every card, not several separate
values that happened to coincide.** `--dhor-row2-h` used to be scoped to
`#card-dhor` alone (40px), while Juz/Position and Duration/Timer each had
their own separately-hardcoded 44px, and Sabaq/Sabaq Dhor's date+history
row had no explicit height at all. All of it now reads from one variable
defined on `.detail-page` (shared by all 4 cards), set once to 44px —
Row 2, Juz, Position, Duration, the Timer button, and Sabaq/Sabaq Dhor's
date row all reference the exact same value now.

**The date field sizes to its own content everywhere, matching Sabaq/
Sabaq Dhor exactly, resolving last round's width question.** Dhor's
Row 2 grid changes from a fixed `40% 30% 30%` to `auto 1fr 1fr` — the
date column now sizes to its own short text (identical to how Sabaq/
Sabaq Dhor's date field has always worked), and Plan/History split
whatever space is left evenly between them, staying comfortably large to
tap rather than being squeezed by a wide date field. This is a system-
level rule now (a content-sized date column), not a one-off percentage
tuned to look right by coincidence.

**Amount switch row given breathing room** — `#dhorAmountRow` gets
`margin-top`, matching the spacing every other row in the card already
has, so it stops crowding Row 2 directly above it.

**Verified, not just read over**: rebuilt the fake-DOM test with a real
`HTMLInputElement`-like prototype (the earlier version's plain object
wasn't a faithful enough stand-in to actually exercise a property-
descriptor override) and confirmed a plain `.value` assignment — the
exact pattern every page uses — now updates the display correctly, while
reading `.value` back still works normally.

## V3.30.0 — Dhor card UI: real root causes fixed, custom date display, rollup default flipped (2026-08-03)

Everything from the last two rounds of UI feedback, including two root
causes found this round that explain why earlier fixes hadn't fully
taken effect.

**Row 3 (Amount switch) — the actual bug, not a re-guess at the width.**
`#dhorAmountRow` had `class="card-date-row"` on it by mistake — that
class belongs to Sabaq/Sabaq Dhor's own 2-column date:history layout
(`grid-template-columns: auto 1fr`), completely unrelated to this
single-switch row. It was forcing the switch into an auto-sized grid
column, so the `width: 78%` fix from last round never had a chance to
apply. The stray class is removed; the switch's own width rule now
actually takes effect.

**Row 2 (History button touching the edge)** — grid items default to
`min-width: auto`, which refuses to shrink a child below its own
content's natural size even when its column is narrower; on a wide card
this goes unnoticed, on a narrow mobile width it can push a button past
its assigned column. `min-width: 0` added to all 3 of Row 2's columns.

**Juz/Position height mismatch** — the Position switch has always had an
explicit `height: 42px`; the Juz `<select>` had none at all, relying on
padding + line-height, which commonly doesn't land on the same computed
height and varies by platform. Both now share one explicit height (44px)
instead of one side guessing at the other.

**Timer/Duration alignment** — centering the whole Timer column isn't
the same as lining up with the Duration *input* specifically, since
Duration has its own label pushing the input down and the Timer column
didn't. An invisible label spacer now sits above the Timer button,
mirroring Duration's real label, and both the input and button share an
explicit height — their bottom edges line up exactly now rather than
approximately. The icon is also bigger (22px → 28px). Found and fixed a
duplicate `#dhorStopwatchToggle` CSS rule along the way — two separate
rules for the same selector had accumulated across earlier rounds; they're
consolidated into one now.

**Custom date display, all 3 date fields (Sabaq/Sabaq Dhor/Dhor)** — a
native `<input type="date">`'s displayed text is entirely browser/OS-
controlled; no CSS can reformat it, which is exactly why two different
screenshots this round showed two different formats for the identical
date. New `js/customDate.js`: wraps each date input (still fully
functional underneath, same id/`.value`/change event, so every existing
read against it is untouched) with a visible button showing a consistent
"DDD dd-MMM" format everywhere; clicking it calls the input's own
`.showPicker()` to open the same native picker as before, with a
focus+click fallback for browsers without that method yet. Padding and
font-size on the visible display are reduced too, per an earlier separate
request folded in here.

**Plan Dhor's "View All Completed"/"View All" now default to rolled-up
Juz** instead of the most granular (quarters) view — all 4 places that
read this default changed.

**Verified, not just read over**: ran the real, extracted
`wireCustomDateDisplay`/`formatCustomDate` code against a fake DOM —
confirmed the wrap/hide/display sequence, the exact formatted output for
2 different dates, live re-rendering on a simulated native picker change,
and that calling it twice never double-wraps.

## V3.29.0 — Pool updates moved to the Dhor card's actual Save; Dhor Plan's range-select fixed for queue wraparound (2026-08-03)

Two related fixes, both confirmed in chat, both about when/how
`baseline_selection` (the Dhor pool) is allowed to change.

**"Execution of the plan happens on the card, not in the plan."** Plan
Dhor's own Save used to merge any newly-selected units into the pool
immediately — before the student had touched the Dhor card at all. If
they then closed the card without logging anything, the pool had already
grown permanently even though nothing was recited and nothing exists in
`dhor_log`. That merge is removed from `savePlanDhorSelection` entirely —
selecting in Plan Dhor now only ever populates the card, same as before,
but touches nothing else.

The merge moves to the Dhor card's own Save handler instead, covering
both the clean-segment path and the raw-range path (both already compute
a real `segment_from`/`segment_to` before this point) — and running
regardless of whether the entry came from a Plan Dhor selection or was
entered fully manually. Fetches the profile fresh rather than trusting
`planDhorPool`, since that's only populated once Plan Dhor's modal has
actually been opened this session — a fully manual entry might never
touch it. Net effect: the pool now only ever grows at the exact moment
something is genuinely logged, from either path, so "in the pool" and
"in Dhor History" can no longer drift apart the way they could before.

**Dhor Plan's tap-first/tap-last range-select is rebuilt to range by
position in the rendered queue, not by quarter-unit value.** The
previous fix (V3.28.0) reused "View All Completed"/"View All"'s existing
range logic as-is, which works by taking the numeric min/max of the two
tapped rows' quarter-units. That's correct for those two tabs' plain
ascending Juz' grid, but Dhor Plan's own rows follow queue order, which
wraps around near the end of the pool — two rows that are genuinely
adjacent in the queue can have numerically distant unit values, and a
value-based range would sweep in anything numerically in between,
whether or not it was ever actually shown between the two tapped rows.

The fix: `renderPlanDhorTabContent`/`renderPlanDhorQueueDayRow` now build
`planDhorQueueRowUnits`, a flat, render-order list of each visible row's
own units, fresh every render; each row carries `data-row-index` instead
of relying on its raw unit values for ranging. A new
`planDhorHandleQueueRowTap(rowIndex)` ranges by index into that list —
tapping two rows selects the union of every row's units strictly between
them, never anything else. As a direct consequence, this also resolves
the earlier "exclude non-pool units" ask as a side effect, with no
separate filtering logic needed: nothing rendered in this tab can hold a
unit outside the pool in the first place, since every row comes from
`computeUpcomingDhorQueue`, itself built entirely from the pool. "View
All Completed"/"View All" are untouched — their rows never wrap, so the
original value-based `planDhorHandleRowTap` still applies there.

**Verified, not just read over**: ran the actual `planDhorHandleQueueRowTap`
against a simulated wrapped queue (today's row far along the pool
numerically, later rows wrapping back near the start) — confirmed that
tapping two rows adjacent in the queue but numerically distant selects
exactly their two rows' units, not anything sitting numerically between
them that was never actually tapped.

## V3.28.0 — Urgent TODO list cleared: 3 real bugs, dead plan-CRUD removed; Dhor card UI polish + Plan Dhor behavior fixes (2026-08-03)

Everything from TODO.md's "Urgent" section, then the previously-deferred
Dhor card/Plan Dhor items in the same delivery.

**Three real bugs, all the same root cause, all fixed.** `isCleanSingleUnit`
and the raw-range Save handler (`js/dhorPage.js`) both destructured
`.quarter` from `quarterUnitToJuzQuarter`'s result — a property that was
never actually there (it returns `.quarterIndex`). `isCleanSingleUnit`'s
version corrupted the Dhor card's Juz/Position fields after a clean
selection from Plan Dhor (`NaN` matching no `<option>`, leaving Juz blank).
The raw-range version is more serious: it's in the actual Save path, so
any raw-range Dhor entry logged before this fix has `NaN` written into
`dhor_log`'s `segment_from`/`segment_to` — flagged on TODO.md as a
decision still needed (repair existing rows, or leave as-is). Both fixed
and verified directly: a half-juz, a full juz, and a single-quarter
selection all now resolve to correct, non-`NaN` values.

**`quarterUnitToJuzQuarter` (`shared/data.js`) is hardened so this exact
mistake can't ship silently a 5th time.** This was the 4th real occurrence
of the same `.quarter`/`.quarterIndex` confusion in this codebase. Its
return value is now wrapped in a `Proxy` — any access to a property other
than `juz`/`quarterIndex` throws immediately, turning a future typo into
a loud, instant error at the exact wrong line instead of a silent `NaN`
surfacing as a confusing symptom several steps downstream. Verified: it
throws on `.quarter`, and works normally for the real properties.

**`apiPlans.create`/`.update`/`.remove` removed entirely** (`js/api.js`,
`handleCreatePlan`/`handleUpdatePlan`/`handleDeletePlan` in
`worker/src/plans.js`, and their 3 routes in `worker/src/index.js`) —
confirmed zero callers anywhere in the app: Dhor's own plan features go
through the queue model instead, and Sabaq/Sabaq Dhor have no planning UI
at all. `GET /plans` (the one real caller, `journal.js`) and its handler
are untouched. `validateBody`/its `isValidDate`/`isInRange` imports are
removed from `plans.js` too — nothing else in that file used them.

**Dhor card UI fixes, originally raised and then dropped from the thread**:
"Plan Dhor"/"Dhor History" shortened to "Plan"/"History" (the likely fix
for the reported button overlap too — the real cause was long text
wrapping inside a fixed-height button, not a missing grid). The Amount
switch is now a percentage width (78%) instead of a fixed 320px cap, so
"Half" no longer clips on wider cards. The "Pre-filled from today's
plan…"/"No plan set up yet…" banner is deleted entirely, along with its
now-empty container div and the `renderDhorPlanBanner` function itself.
"Starting at"'s label text is removed (an invisible spacer keeps Position
vertically aligned with Juz's own label above it). The Timer/stopwatch
column is now vertically centered against Duration beside it.

**Plan Dhor behavior fixes**: rows across all 3 tabs — including Dhor
Plan, which previously used independent checkboxes — now share the same
tap-first/tap-last range-select `.plan-dhor-tap-row` mechanism, so a
selection can't end up non-contiguous. One limitation flagged on
TODO.md, not solved this round: the range is computed by quarter-unit
*number*, correct for the other 2 tabs' plain ascending Juz' grid, but
Dhor Plan's rows follow queue order, which wraps around near the end of
the pool — tapping across a wrap point could select more than intended.
Separately, the "rest of week" rows' expand/collapse is fixed: the day
index was stored as a number when rendered but read back as a string on
tap, so the `Set` lookup could never match and no row would ever expand.

**Verified, not just read over, throughout**: real extracted-code tests
for the Proxy hardening, `isCleanSingleUnit`'s 3 clean-selection shapes,
the new tap-row markup, and the reused range-select logic across 2 taps.

## V3.27.0 — Tomorrow's Portion removed; Pure queue model, Phase C: Plan Dhor's queue view (2026-08-03)

Two pieces of work, done together: closing out the last loose end from
Phase A/D, and the 4-phase rebuild's final planned phase.

**Tomorrow's Portion removed entirely.** Confirmed in chat: it served no
purpose once a student could already redirect the queue by simply saving
a different portion via Plan Dhor. Removed from Setup (`index.html`'s
dropdown/label/hint; `js/settingsScreen.js`'s `renderTomorrowPortionOptions`/
`segmentLabel`/`buildSegmentOptions`, all 4 places that called the render
function, and the save handler's `startSegment` construction). This was
also the last remaining caller of `ensureDhorSchedule`/
`handleEnsureDhorSchedule` anywhere in the app (Phase B had already
removed the only other one, dhorPage.js's open-time top-up) — so that
whole mechanism is now gone too: the function, its route
(`/dhor-schedule/ensure`), and the frontend wrapper
(`js/api.js`'s `apiEnsureDhorSchedule`). Per the standing instruction
confirmed this session — delete superseded code promptly rather than
keeping it for a possible future tie-in, since there are no dependent
users yet to break — nothing here was left as a stub.

**The Dhor card's default Amount/Unit changed from Quarter to Half**,
confirmed in chat. This isn't purely cosmetic any more either: it's now
also the source Plan Dhor's "no Setup configured yet" fallback (below)
reads its granularity from.

**Phase C: Plan Dhor's "Dhor Plan" tab.** Replaces V3.24.1's whole
yesterday/today/next-5-days date-grouped view — dead since Phase A
stopped generating dated rows and Phase D purged what existed — with a
new backend computation, `computeUpcomingDhorQueue`
(`worker/src/dhorSchedule.js`, exposed at `GET /dhor-schedule/upcoming`):
several days' worth of upcoming QUEUE batches, no dates involved
anywhere, reusing `buildChunks`/`findChunkIndexForSegment` rather than
re-deriving the chunking logic a second time. Batch size and granularity
come from `dhor_granularity`/`dhor_quantity`/`dhor_frequency` when Setup's
been configured (e.g. 2 halves twice a day = 4 items/day, the exact
example confirmed in chat); otherwise from the Dhor card's own live
Amount/Unit switch, 1 item/day. Number of day-groups returned is
`dhor_days_of_week`'s own length when set (its cardinality, not specific
weekdays — no calendar involved), else 7. **Flagging rather than
silently assuming**: extending the "has Setup, no history yet" case to
also start from the pool's beginning was Claude's own generalisation of
what was confirmed for the "no Setup, no history" case specifically —
chat didn't address that exact combination, and this was the least-bad
reading available; worth double-checking it matches intent.

On the frontend (`js/dhorPage.js`): `openPlanDhorModal` now calls the new
endpoint instead of three date-keyed `apiPlans.get()` calls, and
pre-selects the first item of today's batch so the tab and the card
visually agree. Today's batch always renders individually, no dates, no
completion status (there's nothing here that can be "done" yet — these
are computed queue positions, not real rows). The rest of the week rolls
up one row per batch (`renderPlanDhorQueueDayRow`, replacing the old
`renderPlanDhorDayGroupRow`) — confirmed as the one deliberate exception
to "no rollup," since a future batch can never have the mixed-completion
ambiguity the old date-grouped rollup had to represent; expand/collapse
here is purely a "see more" affordance, always collapsed again the next
time the modal opens.

**A real bug found and fixed along the way, not something new**:
`quarterUnitLabel` destructured `{ juz, quarter }` from
`quarterUnitToJuzQuarter`, which actually returns `{ juz, quarterIndex }`
— producing "Qundefined" every time. This was already visible in the old
V3.24.1 tab (confirmed from an earlier screenshot showing exactly that
artifact); caught this round via testing while rebuilding the code that
calls it, not newly introduced by this rebuild.

**Verified, not just read over**: ran `computeUpcomingDhorQueue` for real
against 4 scenarios (no pool; no-Setup-no-history with a fallback unit;
continuing correctly after a logged entry; Setup configured with a
3-day-of-week schedule) — confirmed correct wraparound both within a
day's batch and across day boundaries when the pool is smaller than what
a batch needs. Separately ran the actual `renderPlanDhorQueueDayRow`
against collapsed, expanded, and single-item cases, confirming the
`quarterUnitLabel` fix and that a single-item day never renders an
expand control.

## V3.26.2 — Nav dropdown menu fixed to the viewport (2026-08-03)

Standalone fix, unrelated to the Dhor queue rebuild — reported after scrolling
down any page and finding the menu button appeared unresponsive.

**Root cause**: `#authBand` (the top bar) is `position: sticky`, so it
correctly stays pinned to the top as the page scrolls — that part was
never broken, which is why the toggle button itself always felt
reachable. `#authDropdown` (the menu panel it opens) had no positioning
of its own, though, so it sat in normal document flow at its original
spot near the top of the page. Tapping the toggle after scrolling down
genuinely opened it (`max-height` really did expand) — just off-screen,
above the current scroll position, making it look like the tap did
nothing.

**Fix**: `#authDropdown` is now `position: fixed`, anchored directly
under the band regardless of scroll position. The band's actual height
isn't a fixed number (it grows for a device's notch via
`env(safe-area-inset-top)`), so rather than hardcoding an estimate,
`toggleAuthDropdown` (`js/auth.js`) measures the band's real rendered
height and sets it as a CSS variable (`--auth-band-height`) fresh every
time the menu opens.

**Verified, not just read over**: extracted the actual `toggleAuthDropdown`
code and ran it against a fake DOM across open → close → reopen, including
reopening with a deliberately different band height (simulating e.g. a
device rotation between opens) — confirmed it re-measures fresh each open
rather than caching a stale value, and that closing never touches the
height variable.

## V3.26.1 — Dhor card position-selector redesign + a real latent bug fix (2026-08-02)

Follow-up patch within the Phase B round, confirmed in chat after reviewing
a live screenshot: the "Starting at" field always read "Quarter N" even
when Half or Full was the selected unit, which looked contradictory
("Half" next to "Quarter 1") even though the two fields were internally
consistent.

**The dropdown is now a switch, tied to the Amount/Unit value.** Quarter
shows a 4-way switch labeled 1/2/3/4; Half shows a 2-way switch labeled
1/2; Full (Juz) hides the position field entirely — a whole juz' has
exactly one valid starting point, so there's nothing to choose. The Juz/
position row collapses to one column when Full is selected, so Juz's own
field expands to fill the space rather than leaving an empty gap.

**A real bug, not just a labeling one**: switching the Amount switch
never reset Position. Pick Quarter 3, then flip to Full without touching
Position again, and the app would silently compute a segment running
into part of the *next* juz' — not the whole current one — since nothing
ever forced Position back to a value that made sense for the new unit.
Hiding the field for Full (and forcing it to the one valid value) closes
that off structurally, not just visually.

**Works identically for 15-line accounts**, which store raw positions
differently under the hood (15-line has 8 raw markers/juz', not 4) —
Quarter and Half always resolve to exactly 4 and 2 valid slots regardless
of which print is active; only which underlying raw value each slot maps
to differs by ref. Confirmed directly: extracted the real
`renderDhorPositionOptions` code and ran it against both reference
systems, checking the exact raw values each slot produces, not just the
labels.

**Reused, not rebuilt**: the shared switch component (`js/uiSwitch.js`)
already computes option width as a percentage of however many slots
exist — no changes needed there to go from 3-way to 2-way/4-way. A 2-way
variant already existed elsewhere (gender), so this wasn't new ground for
that component, just a new caller of it.

**One behavior worth knowing**: switching Quarter↔Half manually resets
Position to the first slot rather than trying to carry over an
equivalent position — confirmed as the simpler, more predictable choice.
Prepopulation (today's plan, continuing from history, or a Plan Dhor
selection) is unaffected by this reset — those paths set Position to the
actual planned value before the unit switch runs, and that value is
deliberately left alone.

**`renderDhorPicker`** (the old function that unconditionally rebuilt the
position dropdown's options, regardless of unit) is removed — fully
superseded by `renderDhorPositionOptions`, which `setDhorUnit` now calls
directly.

## V3.26.0 — Pure queue model, Phase B: Dhor card prepopulation rewire (2026-08-02)

Second of the 4-phase rebuild. Rewires `js/dhorPage.js` to actually match
the engine V3.25.0 shipped, rather than still branching on sources that
engine can no longer produce.

**The open-time top-up call is gone.** `renderDhorScreen` used to call
`apiEnsureDhorSchedule()` before asking for today's default entry, on the
theory that this would generate a fresh row if one was missing. Since
V3.25.0 made that function an unconditional no-op, the call never changed
what the next fetch would return — removed entirely rather than left as
a pointless round-trip.

**Result-handling collapses to the 3 sources that can actually occur**:
`today_plan`, `continue_last`, or nothing. The `missed_plan`/`future_plan`
branches (impossible since V3.25.0) and the `first_segment` reference
(already impossible since V3.24.0, just never cleaned up) are removed
from both the result-handling `if`/`else` chain and `renderDhorPlanBanner`'s
text map.

**The inline "which one do you mean" picker is gone.** A same-day batch
of more than one `plans` row used to force the student to pick one before
anything pre-filled (the "never auto-selected" rule from V3.9.0) — this
is the one deliberate behavior reversal in the whole 4-phase rebuild,
confirmed in chat. Now the FIRST item in the batch is always pre-filled
directly, fully editable same as any other default; the banner names the
count ("Pre-filled from today's plan (1 of 4 — see Plan Dhor for the
rest)") rather than offering an inline chooser. The rest of the batch
stays visible and selectable through Plan Dhor, which is untouched by
this phase and still shows every row.

**Versioning**: bumped every `?v=` reference in `index.html` and `sw.js`'s
`ASSETS`/`CACHE_NAME` from 3.24.1 to 3.26.0, across all files, not just
`dhorPage.js` — per `CONVENTIONS.md` principle 10, even though only one
JS file's content actually changed.

**Verified, not just read over**: extracted the actual (post-edit)
`renderDhorPlanBanner` function from the delivered file and ran it
against a minimal fake DOM for a single plan, a batch of 4, `continue_last`,
a null source, and a now-dead source (`missed_plan`) — confirmed each
produces the right text, and specifically confirmed the old inline-picker
markup (`data-plan-id`, `#dhorPlanChoices`) is genuinely never generated
any more, not merely hidden.

**Not touched in this delivery, by design**: Plan Dhor's own "Dhor Plan"
tab content (still the yesterday/today/next-5-days layout from V3.24.1)
is Phase C. Setup's "Tomorrow's Portion" and the live purge of existing
`plan_type='dhor'` rows are Phase D. The two prepopulation gaps documented
in V3.24.1 (pool-emptiness checked before `dhor_log`; the manual picker's
Save not updating `baseline_selection`) remain parked, unaffected by this
phase.

## V3.25.0 — Pure queue model, Phase A: scheduling engine rewrite (2026-08-02)

First of a 4-phase rebuild (confirmed in chat) correcting the underlying
Dhor scheduling model. The model shipped through V3.24.1 treated `plans`
as a calendar of dated commitments — a rolling window of future rows,
pre-generated ahead of time, with "missed" (backdated catch-up) and
"future" (borrowed early) fallbacks for whenever that window didn't line
up with today. Confirmed wrong: `plans` is a single ordered QUEUE, no
dates baked into any not-yet-done item. "Continue from where it left off"
always means the last thing actually logged in `dhor_log`, with the queue
picking up right after it — nothing else. If a daily quota is 4 halves and
only 2 get done, the other 2 simply stay first in the queue, done
whenever the student next does Dhor; there's no separate "missed" or
"future" concept to reconcile.

**`ensureDhorSchedule` (`worker/src/dhorSchedule.js`)**: the entire
rolling-window generation loop is removed — it used to walk the next 7
active days and INSERT dated `plans` rows ahead of time; now it's a
harmless no-op (`{ generated: 0 }`), unconditionally. Kept rather than
deleted so its two existing callers (dhorPage.js's open-time top-up, and
Setup's save handler, which would otherwise show a false "Couldn't save"
error if this started throwing) don't need to change in this phase. The
now-unused `DAY_ABBR`/`WINDOW_DAYS`/`addDays`/`dateToUTCWeekday` helpers,
which only existed to support that loop, are removed with it.

**`computeDefaultDhorEntry`**: collapses from 5 branches to 1 rule — an
explicit override for today if a `plans` row exists for it (the only way
one currently can, since generation no longer creates any), else ALWAYS
the segment following the last logged entry. The "missed plan" and
"future plan" branches are removed entirely — they only ever existed
because plans used to carry dates. `buildChunks`/`findChunkIndexForSegment`
are unchanged and still do the actual chunking work for the fallback
branch. Verified directly (not just read over): a small standalone
harness mocking `env.DB` confirmed `ensureDhorSchedule` now touches the
database zero times, and confirmed `computeDefaultDhorEntry`'s three
remaining outcomes (today's plan / continue from last / genuinely blank)
each still produce the right shape.

**Not touched in this delivery, by design**: dhorPage.js still has
handling code for the now-impossible `missed_plan`/`future_plan` sources
(dead, not broken — same pattern as `first_segment` becoming dead code in
V3.24.0) — cleaning that up, and wiring the card's own prepopulation to
auto-populate the first item of a multi-item batch, is Phase B. Plan
Dhor's Dhor Plan tab (yesterday/today/next-5-days) is Phase C. Setup's
"Tomorrow's Portion" and the live-DB purge of existing `plan_type='dhor'`
rows are Phase D — confirmed to ship without an intentional pause after
this phase, rather than holding D back as a separately-timed step. Also
carried forward, unaffected by this phase: the two prepopulation gaps
documented in V3.24.1 (pool-emptiness checked before `dhor_log`; the
manual picker's Save not updating `baseline_selection`).

## V3.24.1 — Dhor Schedule generation fix + Dhor Plan tab redesign (2026-08-02)

Found through live debugging on two real accounts, both traced to
verified root causes rather than assumed — two earlier hypotheses
(an empty `dhor_days_of_week`, a silently-failing generator) were
checked directly against the data and ruled out before the actual
cause was found.

**Real bug in `buildChunks`**: `sessionSize = quartersPerUnit *
quantity` was multiplying quantity INTO each chunk's size, so "Half
granularity, quantity 2" produced one combined full-juz-sized chunk per
session instead of two separate half-sized ones. Confirmed correct
behavior: "Two half juz twice a day should generate four rows every
day" (2 sessions × 2 portions/session = 4 separate half-sized rows).
Fixed: `buildChunks` now always produces chunks at exactly one
granularity-unit each; `quantity` multiplies into rows-per-active-day
in `ensureDhorSchedule`'s generation loop instead. Worth knowing: this
only affects rows generated *after* this fix — a day's row-count is
locked in whenever that day was "tomorrow" in an earlier generation
run, so already-existing plan rows (e.g. from before this update) won't
retroactively split into the corrected shape; only fresh generation for
not-yet-reached days will.

**Dhor Plan tab was missing every row's date** — fixed, now shows
`target_date` on every row.

**The Dhor Plan tab's actual job, reframed and rebuilt**: not just
"today's session," but yesterday (was it covered) / today (confirm
what's expected) / the next 5 days (what's coming) — confirmed as the
minimum useful view. Today shows every row individually. Yesterday and
each of the next 5 days roll up into ONE summary row per day when there
are multiple sessions that day — "[date]: Portion A to Portion B" (the
earliest session's start through the latest session's end). Every row
gets a checkbox; a plan already `status='completed'` shows checked and
disabled rather than a live control. A rolled-up day with genuinely
mixed completion (some sessions logged, some not) is expandable instead
of trying to represent that in one ambiguous checkbox — tapping it
reveals the individual underlying sessions, each with its own normal
state. Confirmed: this tab stays view-only for plans themselves (no
edit/delete facility for a plan's date or portion exists anywhere) —
selecting a portion here loads it into the Dhor card's own form, same
as everywhere else in Plan Dhor; the user still saves from there.

**Not in this delivery, documented but not yet fixed**: two other
prepopulation bugs found during this same debugging session —
`computeDefaultDhorEntry` checks whether the pool is empty before ever
querying `dhor_log`, so a student with an empty Setup pool but real
logged Dhor history never gets branch 4 ("continue from last entry") a
chance to fire; and only Plan Dhor's own save path adds a newly-logged
segment to `baseline_selection` — the regular manual picker's Save does
not, breaking "logging Dhor builds history" for that path specifically.
Both documented for a future round, not folded into this one.

## V3.24.0 — Plan Dhor (2026-08-02)

The full Plan Dhor rebuild, replacing the read-only "View Plan" popup
entirely, plus the row layout changes and a global spelling sweep that
were queued alongside it.

**Global spelling sweep**: "Juz'" → "Juz" across every piece of
user-facing text in the app (10 fixes across 5 files) — deliberately
scoped to display text only, not internal code comments.

**Dhor card layout**: Row 2 is now Date : Plan Dhor : Dhor History in a
40:30:30 grid with fixed-height, wrapping (not truncating) buttons. Row
3 is Amount as a 3-way switch (Quarter/Half/Full), reusing the app's
existing shared switch component, sized to 75% of Row 2's height via a
CSS custom property rather than a guessed value. Row 6's Duration field
changed from decimal minutes to mm:ss text (placeholder "mm:ss",
colon-less digits read as whole minutes), labeled "TIMER" instead of
"Stopwatch" — and since mm:ss is a lossless round-trip (unlike the old
1-decimal-minute display), the V3.21.1 exact-seconds-bypass mechanism
is gone entirely, a real simplification, not just a rename.

**Plan Dhor**: the "View Plan" button is renamed "Plan Dhor" and opens a
much richer screen — a title/Save/Close row, then a 3-way tab switch
(Dhor Plan / View All Completed / View All). Dhor Plan shows today's
scheduled sessions as simple independent checkboxes (this is also where
the old inline "more than one plan for today" picker moves to and is
removed from the card entirely). The two View tabs show all 30 Juz,
grouped with the same roll-up/down mechanism already proven for Sabaq
Dhor, using **tap-first, tap-last range-select** rather than per-row
checkboxes — tap a start point, tap an end point, everything between is
selected; a third tap starts an entirely new range rather than
extending it, which makes a non-contiguous selection structurally
impossible to create. A Select All action is included. View All greys
out anything not yet marked complete but keeps it selectable — saving
something not yet in the pool adds it to `baseline_selection`.

**Save logic, deliberately simple**: if the selection reduces to one
clean quarter/half/juz, it populates Juz/Position/Amount exactly as the
manual picker already does, and Mistakes/Duration work normally.
Anything else (doesn't reduce to one clean unit, or spans more than one
juz) shows: *"Your times and mistakes will not be recorded for this
selection. Cancel to review, OK to continue."* Continuing switches the
card into a From/To display — Mistakes, Tajweed, and the Timer become
disabled, Notes stays available — and tapping either From or To reopens
Plan Dhor with the current selection already ticked, rather than being
edited inline. The user still has to hit the card's own Save to create
the record; Plan Dhor only ever populates the form. (An earlier,
considerably more complex design — decomposing a selection into
multiple clean groups and proportionally splitting mistakes/duration
across them, with a 5-checkbox cap and a 2-run non-contiguous cap — was
fully worked through in chat and then deliberately scrapped in favor of
this simpler version before any of it was built.)

**Backend correction**: `computeDefaultDhorEntry`'s "no plan, no
history at all" case used to default to the first eligible segment —
changed to genuinely blank, since a brand-new student with nothing in
their pool yet realistically isn't doing Dhor. Once their first entry
is ever saved, the existing "continue from last entry" logic takes over
normally — logging builds history the same way Setup's baseline marking
does.

**Caught before shipping:** two real gaps found while reviewing this
before packaging, not after. (1) No CSS had actually been written for
the entire Plan Dhor modal — it would have rendered completely
unstyled. Added comprehensively, reusing the same shared-grid pattern
already proven for Sabaq Dhor's checkbox list. (2) Editing an existing
Dhor entry while raw-range mode was active would have left Mistakes/
Duration stuck disabled and a stale From/To row visible underneath the
edit screen — `loadDhorEntryForEdit` now exits raw-range mode first.

## V3.23.1 — Dhor layout polish, pre-Phase B (2026-08-01)

Confirmed batch of Dhor-specific UI changes, requested before moving on
to Phase B:

- **Amount + View Plan** now sit in their own row directly below the
  date (reusing the date row's exact grid for visual consistency).
  **View Plan** is new — a popup listing upcoming scheduled Dhor
  sessions (`plan_type='dhor'`, `status='planned'`, `target_date >=`
  today), the mirror image of History's popup but facing forward in
  time instead of back. Reuses the existing `/plans?since=` query,
  no backend changes needed for this one.
- **Mistakes + Tajweed** now share one line, matching the pattern
  already used elsewhere (Sabaq's Lines/Pages, Sabaq Dhor's own
  Mistakes/Tajweed from V3.20.0).
- **Duration + Stopwatch**: Duration's column is now a clean 50% (same
  `.picker-row` grid used everywhere else), with a Stopwatch icon
  button (user's exact `timer.svg`) beside it, centered. The actual
  timer widget (Start/Stop/Lap) is no longer always visible — it's
  hidden by default and toggles open/closed via the Stopwatch button.
- **"Seg X-Y" replaced with "Juz X" / "Juz X H1"-"H2" / "Juz X
  Q1"-"Q4" everywhere it appeared** — the History popup, the
  multi-plan-for-today picker, and the edit-screen's "not editable
  here" text. This was explicitly parked in three earlier rounds
  specifically for "when Dhor's own detail work happens" — this is
  that moment. New `describeDhorSegment` helper reuses the existing
  `segmentRangeToPicker` rather than re-deriving juz'/unit a second way.

**Also fixed while restructuring:** Amount is functionally part of the
same segment-determination system as Juz'/Starting-at (all three
together produce `segment_from`/`segment_to`), so it needed to hide
during edit alongside the segment picker for the same reason those two
already do — moving it into its own row for layout purposes had
initially left it out of that hide/show toggle; caught and fixed before
shipping rather than after.

## V3.23.0 — Dhor detail rebuild, Phase A (2026-08-01)

**Dhor's default entry is no longer just "today's plan or blank."**
Confirmed design: `computeDefaultDhorEntry` (new, `worker/src/dhorSchedule.js`)
now checks, in order: (1) today's plan(s) — unchanged from before; (2) no
entry for today → the most recently MISSED plan, backdated to *that
plan's own date* (a genuine catch-up entry, not logged as today); (3) no
missed entries → the closest upcoming plan, borrowed early under today's
date; (4) no plan at all but real Dhor history exists → the segment that
follows the last logged entry, walking the eligible pool forward at
*that entry's own granularity* — a deliberate choice to match what the
student actually just did, not the account's configured Setup
granularity/quantity (which is what `ensureDhorSchedule`'s own anchor
logic uses for auto-generating future plan rows — a related but
different question); (5) no plan and no history at all → the very first
eligible segment, quarter granularity.

Reuses the existing `buildChunks`/`findChunkIndexForSegment` (this same
file, already proven via `ensureDhorSchedule`) rather than building a
second copy of that gap-aware chunking logic. New endpoint:
`GET /dhor-schedule/default-entry`. The Dhor form now shows a hint
explaining *why* something was pre-filled ("catching up on...",
"continuing from your last session", etc.) instead of populating
silently.

**3 UI fixes, applied across all 3 cards** (shared CSS/HTML, not
Dhor-specific) since they're deferred groundwork for this same rebuild:
- Cancel removed from the edit-screen top bar (redundant with the bottom
  bar's Cancel) — and the now-orphaned JS listeners for those buttons
  were removed too, checked deliberately given how the last critical bug
  happened.
- The date field is no longer a fixed 30% column that could truncate the
  rendered date — now sized to its own natural width.
- History moved into the same row as the date field, right-justified
  with edge padding, height-matched to the date field via the row's own
  `align-items:stretch` rather than a hardcoded pixel value. Width was
  deliberately left unconstrained (sized to its own label) rather than
  forced to match the date field's width too, since "Sabaq Dhor History"
  would otherwise risk wrapping on a narrower screen — flagging this as
  a specific interpretation choice, not an oversight.

## V3.22.1 — Edit screen polish + null-entry crash fix (2026-08-01)

Three fixes, all confirmed in chat after V3.22.0 went live:

**Topbar/date order was backwards.** The confirmed layout was "Editing
[Type] from [date]" as Row 1, date field as Row 2 below it — V3.22.0
built it in the opposite order. Fixed by reordering the two elements in
`index.html` for all 3 cards. The edit topbar is hidden in normal view
regardless, so this has no effect outside edit mode.

**Sabaq's Delete button now hides entirely for the frontier entry**,
rather than just being disabled — same restriction as before (deleting
the entry `position.sabaqTo` is currently based on isn't allowed), just
not shown as an option at all instead of shown-but-greyed-out.

**Real crash fixed: entries with a null sabaq_from/sabaq_to (shown as
"null-null" in History) couldn't be opened for editing at all.**
`loadSabaqEntryForEdit` called `.split(':')` directly on
`entry.sabaq_from`/`entry.sabaq_to` — if either is genuinely `null`
rather than a string, that throws immediately, before anything else in
the function runs. Since the History popup had already closed by that
point, the failure was invisible: the screen just silently stayed on
the normal Sabaq view, with no way to reach Delete for that entry at
all. Fixed with a small parsing helper that falls back to the same "—"
placeholder state `renderVerseRefField` already shows for a genuinely
empty field, instead of crashing — the edit screen (and Delete) now
opens correctly for these entries regardless of how malformed their
historical data is.

## V3.22.0 — Dedicated edit screen + Delete (2026-08-01)

**Edit now opens as a full takeover, not an inline banner.** Confirmed
design: tapping the pencil icon on a History row now hides the tabs/dots
row and every card except the one being edited, and within that card
replaces the normal header (icon/heading/Save) with a grey top bar
reading "Editing [Type] from [date]" + Cancel, and adds a matching grey
bottom bar with three centered buttons: Cancel, Delete (red background),
and Update (styled exactly like the existing Save icon). This isn't a
new entry in the screen router (`js/app.js`) — it's a mode toggle within
the existing log-detail screen, specifically so the already-working
verse-ref grid, tajweed picker, and comment block don't need to be
rebuilt a second time for a separate screen.

**Delete is now wired up**, reusing the DELETE endpoints that already
existed server-side (confirmed in an earlier chat, never previously
attached to any button): `apiSabaq.remove`, `apiSabaqDhor.remove`,
`apiDhor.remove`. Confirmation wording, exact as specified: "Deleting
this entry may create gaps in your history which cannot be recovered.
Are you sure you want to DELETE?"

**Sabaq's Delete button is disabled (not hidden) for the frontier
entry** — the one `position.sabaqTo` is currently based on — since
deleting it would leave position pointing at a row that no longer
exists. Sabaq Dhor and Dhor have no such restriction; neither has a
position concept tied to individual entries.

**Consistency pass while rebuilding this:** Dhor's segment picker
(Juz'/Starting at/Amount/plan banner) now hides during edit, matching
Sabaq Dhor's existing precedent of hiding pickers that reflect today's
live options rather than what was actually chosen on the edited day —
previously it stayed visible but non-functional during edit, which
could read as if changing it did something.

**Caught before shipping, not after this time:** the three `renderX
Screen()` functions that reset stale state on every fresh screen open
still referenced the old banner element IDs removed by this same
change — the identical *shape* of failure as V3.21.2's critical bug
(a missing element reference that would silently break the screen),
just caught this time by deliberately grepping for the old IDs before
calling this done, rather than after a user found it live.

**Post-delivery correction:** `js/logDetailScreen.js` — which holds
`enterEditScreenMode`/`exitEditScreenMode` themselves, referenced by all
three of the files above — was edited as part of this change but
accidentally left out of the zip that was actually delivered. Confirmed
live: `ReferenceError: Can't find variable: exitEditScreenMode`, and
History disappearing again, for the same underlying reason as V3.21.2
(a function call to something that doesn't exist where it's being
called from) but caused by an incomplete delivery this time, not a code
ordering mistake. Re-delivered as a single-file follow-up; no code
changes, no version bump — `js/logDetailScreen.js` was already tagged
`?v=3.22.0` in `index.html`, it just hadn't actually been uploaded yet.

## V3.21.2 — CRITICAL FIX: Save was broken on all 3 cards (2026-08-01)

**Root cause: `EDIT_HANDLERS` was used before it was declared.** V3.21.0
added `js/dhorPage.js:237: EDIT_HANDLERS.dhor = loadDhorEntryForEdit;`,
but the `const EDIT_HANDLERS = {}` declaration itself didn't get added
until line 328 — much further down in the same file. A `const` binding
is unusable from the top of its scope until its own declaration line
actually runs, so line 237 threw
`ReferenceError: Cannot access 'EDIT_HANDLERS' before initialization`
the instant the page loaded, which halted every remaining top-level
statement in that script.

That's a much bigger problem than it sounds, because **Save's click
handler is wired up further down in the same file, after that line** —
so it never got attached. Since the crash meant the `const` itself never
ran, `js/sabaqPage.js` and `js/sabaqDhorPage.js` (which load after
`dhorPage.js` and each do their own `EDIT_HANDLERS.sabaq = ...` /
`EDIT_HANDLERS.sabaqDhor = ...`) hit the identical error, halting their
scripts too — and their Save handlers are wired up right after those
lines as well. **Net effect: Save silently stopped working on Sabaq,
Sabaq Dhor, and Dhor, and History never appeared on any of the 3 cards**
(`renderRecentEntries`, defined further down in the crashed
`dhorPage.js`, was never successfully reachable either). Confirmed live
in the repo the user re-uploaded, not just suspected from re-reading the
code.

**Fix:** `EDIT_HANDLERS` is now declared right at the top of
`js/dhorPage.js`, before anything in any of the three files can
reference it. This is the only change needed — the assignments and
usages elsewhere were already correct, they just needed the declaration
to actually exist first.

**Also, Sabaq Dhor's checkbox alignment — genuinely fixed this time.**
The 80:20-grid-per-row approach from V3.20.0/V3.20.1 was the wrong tool
for cross-row alignment: each row computed its own 80%/20% split against
its own box, so consistency across rows was never actually guaranteed,
just usually close. `#sabaqDhor_sections` is now itself ONE shared CSS
grid (`1fr auto auto`); every row contributes exactly 3 direct grid
children (text, a Move-to-Dhor button or an empty placeholder to keep
column position stable, checkbox) so every checkbox genuinely shares the
same column across every row, the way an HTML table's cells would.

## V3.21.1 — Dhor duration becomes a real input (2026-08-01)

**Note on this delivery: bundled with V3.21.0.** V3.21.0 was never actually
uploaded to production, so this zip contains every file changed by BOTH
V3.21.0 and V3.21.1 together — the live site is still on V3.20.0.

**Duration is now a genuine user input, not something only the timer can
set.** Confirmed in chat: the timer is meant to be an assistive feature
that fills duration in for you and additionally captures lap times (real
richer data a manual entry can't provide) — it was never supposed to be
the *only* way to record a duration. Previously there was no manual
field at all; `js/timer.js` has no `<input>` elements, so
`duration_seconds` could only ever come from actually running the timer.

Added a "Duration (minutes)" field above the timer. The timer auto-fills
it (and separately captures lap times) when used, but it's directly
editable at any time — before, during, or after using the timer.
Stored value is still seconds (unchanged column), entered/displayed in
minutes.

Two precision/consistency details, both confirmed in chat:
- The field displays 1 decimal place, but the timer's real precision
  isn't lost to that rounding — if the field is left exactly as the
  timer set it, saving uses the timer's exact seconds value directly,
  not a re-parse of the rounded "12.6" display text. Detecting "did the
  user actually touch this" relies on a real quirk: setting `.value`
  programmatically doesn't fire an `input` event, only genuine typing
  does — so the auto-fill and the override-detection cleanly never
  collide.
- Manually overriding the duration clears lap times, since laps that no
  longer sum to the new total would be actively misleading rather than
  just unused.

This also meant fixing V3.21.0's Dhor edit flow: duration and lap times
were excluded from editing specifically because no editable field
existed for them yet. That reasoning no longer applies now that one
does, so editing a past Dhor entry includes them like any other field.
Segment (from a picker reflecting today's live options, not what was
actually chosen on the edited day) is still excluded — that part of the
original reasoning still holds.

## V3.21.0 — Edit past entries + checkbox alignment fix (2026-08-01)

**Sabaq Dhor checkbox alignment** — the fix identified but held back last
round is now in: `.sabaq-dhor-section-row span` gets `min-width: 0`, so a
longer label like "Quarter 3 (current): 83:1 - 86:2" wraps within its 80%
column instead of overflowing it and dragging that row's checkbox out of
line with shorter rows.

**Editing past entries — confirmed design.** A single edit (pencil) icon
per row in the History popup (Sabaq/Sabaq Dhor/Dhor), loading that entry
into the card's own form rather than a separate edit UI — reuses every
existing field/picker/validation as-is. Saving PATCHes the row.

The important nuance, confirmed in chat: this is NOT "delete and re-save
for every edit." That would be actively risky — recomputing Sabaq's
position from whichever entry happens to be getting a typo fixed today,
even a weeks-old one, would silently drag the student's position
backward. Position is now only ever recomputed when the entry being
edited is confirmed to be the current frontier (the one `position.sabaqTo`
was actually derived from — checked once, when the entry is loaded, by
comparing it against the most recent entry in that student's own history).
Editing any other Sabaq entry saves the content and leaves position alone.

Sabaq Dhor and Dhor have no position side effects to worry about, but
have their own real constraint: their range fields (Sabaq Dhor's
from/to, Dhor's segment_from/to) reflect a picker or checkbox set built
from *today's* live options, not whatever was actually true on the day
being edited — there's no way to correctly reconstruct that UI for a
past entry. So editing those two only ever touches mistakes, tajweed
tags, and notes; the range (and Dhor's timer data, which can't be
redone either) is simply never included in the PATCH and stays exactly
as originally recorded. The banner shown while editing says so
explicitly, and the section checkboxes / rollup stepper are hidden on
Sabaq Dhor while editing since they'd otherwise look actionable but
silently do nothing.

Also fixed while building this: reopening any of the 3 cards now
explicitly resets editing state. Without it, closing the screen mid-edit
(e.g. via xclose) without saving or cancelling would leave the next
save on a fresh visit silently PATCHing the old entry instead of
creating a new one.

## V3.20.0 — Prepopulation frontier fix + UI polish (2026-08-01)

**Sabaq position frontier — two more real bugs found live, after V3.19.0.**

Bug 1: `advancePositionAfterSabaq` still trusted "to" as the frontier
unconditionally. That breaks for a bulk/historical catch-up entry whose
fields were filled in ascending numeric order rather than the juz's
actual study/chronological order — e.g. From=88:1/To=114:6 for a juz' 30
student actually means surahs 89-114 are fully done and only ayah 1 of
88 is, so 88:1 (not 114:6) is the real frontier. Fixed by comparing both
endpoints via `shared/data.js`'s existing `compareVerseKey` against the
juz's real study direction (lower endpoint = frontier for juz' 30,
higher = frontier for every other juz'), instead of assuming either
field always plays a fixed role. This corrects the logic from here
onward; it does NOT retroactively fix already-stored position data for
students already affected by the old logic — that needs a one-time
direct D1 correction, separate from this delivery.

Bug 2: `nextSabaqDefaults` gated on `hasDhor` unconditionally, so a
student with real Sabaq history AND any Dhor history at all got nothing
prepopulated. The no-prepopulate rule was only ever meant for the
no-Sabaq-history case — real Sabaq history should always prepopulate
regardless of Dhor history. This one needed no data correction: the
underlying position record was already correct, only the display logic
was wrong.

**UI polish, all confirmed in chat:**
- Save button (all 4 cards): icon doubled in size, whole icon+label unit
  now centered both ways within its grid cell instead of hugging the
  column's right edge.
- Sabaq Dhor section rows: rebuilt as an explicit 80:20 grid (text :
  checkbox) instead of flex + space-between, so the checkbox sits at a
  consistent position across every row instead of trailing wherever that
  row's text happens to end.
- Sabaq Dhor: Mistakes and Tajweed now share one line, reusing the same
  `.picker-row` 2-column pattern already used for Sabaq's own Lines/Pages
  fields.

## V3.19.0 — Detail-screen UI round 4 + real prepopulation fix (2026-07-31)

**Sabaq prepopulation — real root cause found, not a rendering issue.**
`shared/data.js` already had a fully-written, exported helper,
`nextSabaqPosition`, specifically for advancing one ayah past a given
position in the correct study direction (backwards for juz' 30, forwards
otherwise) — it just was never actually called anywhere. `nextSabaqDefaults`
(`js/position.js`) was reusing `position.sabaqTo` directly as the new
From/To, which repeats the exact ayah the last entry already ended on
instead of continuing past it. Fixed by wiring `nextSabaqPosition` in;
also added a `juzComplete` check so prepopulation stays silent (rather
than guessing) once advancing would leave the juz' entirely.

**Icon-button convention.** The Save button (all 4 cards) now matches
Hifzhelper's own existing `.nav-icon-item` pattern — icon on top, label
below, no border/background — instead of being a special-cased bordered
button. This is the new default for in-app icon buttons generally, not
just Save. Label stays normal weight; caps come from `text-transform`,
not the underlying string.

**Xclose control.** The log-detail screen (Sabaq/Sabaq Dhor/Dhor/Tadabbur)
now has an exit icon on the right of the swipe-dots row, using the
provided Lucide `square-x` source. Exits to Journal — the app has no
navigation history stack, just direct screen switches, and Journal is the
landing page this screen is always reached from. The dots row is now a
3-column grid (spacer:dots:close) so dots stay centered independently of
the close button; only the dots hide on desktop (≥1180px), the close
button stays visible at every size.

**Sabaq Dhor "Sections to revise" redesign.** Heading text removed
entirely; "Mark sections revised" now labels the checkbox list
specifically. Checkboxes moved to the right side of each row. Default
changed from checked to unchecked — this was a real bug, not styling:
`renderSabaqDhorRows` was hardcoding `checked` on every row, forcing
everything pre-selected instead of letting a student actually mark what
was revised. The existing "please check at least one section" validation
in the save handler already covers the resulting empty-selection case, no
changes needed there.

**Rollup control redesign.** The two rollup buttons are now a compact
2-icon vertical stepper sitting to the left of the section list (was a
full-width row above it), using the provided Lucide
`list-chevrons-down-up`/`list-chevrons-up-down` icons in place of the
plain ▲/▼ glyphs. Each button is now hidden entirely (not just a no-op
tap) whenever its direction wouldn't actually change anything — rather
than hand-duplicating `computeSabaqDhorRows`' own merge conditions
(pairs, full-juz' logic, lingering-juz' rows) to detect eligibility
separately, `updateRollupStepperVisibility` computes the rows one level
up and down and compares row-id sets directly, so eligibility can never
drift out of sync with what the button would actually do.

**Deferred, not in this round:** relabeling the Dhor Plan picker's raw
"Seg 113-116"/"Seg 117-120" buttons (segment_from/segment_to quarter-unit
IDs) into a human-readable form — parked for when Dhor's own detail work
happens.

## V3.18.0 — Detail-screen UI round 3 (2026-07-31)

Bismillah. This round's scope was fixing UI items confirmed after V3.17.0
went live — Sabaq Dhor confirmed working, so this leaves the Sabaq
prepopulation bug for a later revision as agreed, and focuses purely on
this round's UI list.

**Header, all 4 cards**: rebuilt as two explicit CSS grids instead of the
old flex row — row 1 is icon:heading:save at 10:70:20, row 2 is
date:blank at 30:70. `save-status` and the Save button are now grouped
into one wrapper so they share column 3 as a single grid item instead of
each auto-placing into its own column.

**Notes/Private**: the Private checkbox + label move up onto the same
row as the "Notes" label itself, replacing the row that used to sit
below the textarea.

**"Recent" → History button only**: the heading text is gone entirely,
and the last-2-entries list under the History button is removed per the
confirmed scope — the button alone (now compact and dark green/Evergreen,
with type-specific text: "Sabaq History", "Sabaq Dhor History", "Dhor
History") is enough for now. It still opens the same full popup (up to
50 entries) as before.

**Verse-ref fields (Sabaq from/to) — real bug found, rebuilt, not
patched**: these were flagged as "erratic"/chevrons "not visible at all."
Root cause: the flex version had no `min-width` guard on the surah
label, so a long name could eat into a sibling's share depending on
exactly how much room flex gave it that render — the same underlying
issue (an unconstrained sibling silently stealing a neighbour's assigned
space) as the V3.14.1 ayah-width bug, just via flex-basis this time
instead of a specificity fight. Rebuilt as an explicit 4-column CSS grid
(chevron:Surah:Ayah:chevron at 10:50:30:10, confirmed in chat) with
`min-width: 0` on every text-bearing cell, so each column keeps its
assigned share regardless of content length. Left chevron is unchanged
(still opens the surah picker). **New**: the right-hand chevron column
is an explicit up/down stepper for the ayah value — added because it
was the *native number input's own spinner* that wasn't rendering, so
this replaces reliance on it entirely rather than trying to make it
visible; dispatches a `change` event so it flows through the exact same
sync/recompute logic as typing a value in directly. Flagging this as an
assumption, not a confirmed spec: the 4th column's exact behaviour
(ayah stepper) wasn't explicitly specified, just its width.

**Swipe dots — real bug found, root cause was outside the file being
debugged**: `updateLogDetailDots` compared `card.offsetLeft` against
`rail.scrollLeft`, which silently broke once `#appContent` gained
`transform: translateZ(0)` (V3.4.3's Safari-paint fix, in `css/base.css`)
— a transformed ancestor becomes the nearest `offsetParent` for elements
inside it in every major browser, so each card's `offsetLeft` was
actually measured from `#appContent`'s edge, several DOM levels above
the rail, not from the rail's own content box. That added a constant
(`#appContent`'s own padding) to every comparison, so a dot only flipped
"active" once you'd scrolled well past where the card had actually
snapped into place — matching the "erratic"/"misaligned" report exactly,
and invisible from reading either file in isolation. Fixed by switching
to `getBoundingClientRect()`, which is always viewport-relative and
can't drift the same way regardless of any ancestor's transform/position
tricks.

**Housekeeping**: the three Recent-rail container divs (`sabaqRecentRail`
etc.) previously carried the pre-V3.14.2 `.swipe-rail` class, left over
from before the History-button redesign and now meaningless (nothing
scrolls horizontally there any more) — given their own plain
`.history-container` class instead while already touching this markup.

## V3.17.0 — Phase 2b: the move-to-Dhor transition (2026-07-31)

Bismillah. Completes the Sabaq Dhor rebuild — the last piece confirmed
in chat, and the one most likely to have a subtle bug, given how many
moving parts it touches. Bundled complete, same as before: nothing from
V3.14.0 onward had been uploaded yet.

**Two independent paths to the same outcome**, confirmed in chat —
whichever fires first:
- **Manual**: a "Move to Dhor" button now appears next to any row that's
  eligible (halves and full juz' only, never a lone quarter) — clicking
  it adds that row's quarter-units directly into `baseline_selection`
  (Dhor Schedule's own eligibility pool, from V3.15.0's rework).
- **Automatic**: `js/position.js`'s new `maybeAutoMoveToDhor`, called
  right after every Sabaq save — if a previous juz' is still lingering
  and this save just completed at least one quarter of the *new* juz',
  whatever's left of the old one moves to Dhor on its own.

**Progressive eligibility, exactly as specified**: a lone quarter never
has the Dhor option. A First Half always does, once complete. A Second
Half only gets it once First Half has *actually* moved — checked
directly against `baseline_selection` membership (being in that pool
*is* "already moved"), not a separately-tracked flag. Caught a real bug
here before shipping: my first version only showed Second Half as a row
once First Half had moved, when it should always be visible for
revision — the sequential rule governs the Dhor *option*, not whether
the row shows at all. Fixed and re-verified.

**`previousJuz` tracking**: `advancePositionAfterSabaq` now preserves
every other field on `position` instead of replacing the object outright
— its first version would have silently dropped Phase 2a's rollup
preference on every single save, a bug caught in this round's own
review rather than shipped. It also now records which juz' was just left
behind whenever Sabaq crosses a boundary, which is what both the
lingering rows and the auto-trigger read.

Every scenario tested directly with real numbers before packaging:
juz' 30→29 crossing sets `previousJuz` correctly; the auto-trigger
correctly does *not* fire before a quarter of the new juz' is done, and
correctly *does* fire (with the right quarter-units) once it is; lingering
rows show both halves when neither has moved, only Second Half once
First has, and disappear entirely once both have.

Bismillah. This delivery bundles everything still pending from V3.14.0
onward (none of it had been uploaded yet) plus this round's work, all in
one download as requested — nothing here assumes any earlier zip made
it live.

**UI notes, all 4 detail cards:**
- Header is now 2 rows: row 1 is icon + heading (left) and Save (right,
  icon styled like the nav icons, with actual "Save" text next to it —
  reverses the icon-only version from before); row 2 is just the date,
  at 30% width. Putting date and heading on the same row didn't work in
  practice, per direct feedback on what shipped.
- Privacy reverts from the large Public/Private switch back to a plain
  checkbox next to "Notes" (default unchecked = public) — judged too
  much control for what's a minor, occasional toggle.
- "Recent" becomes a "History" button plus the last 2 entries shown
  stacked directly underneath; tapping History opens the full list (up
  to 50 entries) in a popup. Replaces the swipe rail entirely.

**Sabaq-specific: page count is now a fixed-standard capacity measure**,
not a real-page lookup — always divides by 13 lines/page and rounds
down to the nearest quarter-page (20 lines → 1.538 → 1.5), regardless of
mushaf print or which real pages were actually touched. Confirmed in
chat: this is a volume/capacity measure, not a progress tracker, so it
doesn't need real per-print page data at all — just the line count
(still computed properly per-print) divided by that constant.

**Phase 2a — Sabaq Dhor's rollup mechanism.** New `computeSabaqDhorRows`
(`js/position.js`) builds the actual displayable rows: the current,
still-in-progress quarter is always its own row and never rollable
(confirmed: only already-finished units can merge); completed quarters
can be rolled up via a chevron — 1+2 into "First Half", 3+4 into "Second
Half" (fixed pairing), both halves into "Full Juz'" — and back down
again. The rollup level is persisted per student
(`position.sabaqDhorRollup`) so it sticks across sessions. Tested 3
scenarios before shipping: an unmergeable lone completed quarter (its
partner not done yet), a clean half-merge, and the "nothing complete
yet" case (just the current row, chevron a no-op).

Each row also carries a `canMoveToDhor` flag (true for halves and full
juz', never a lone quarter) — this delivery doesn't act on it. The
actual move-to-Dhor transition (tickbox + auto-trigger) is Phase 2b, a
separate delivery once this mechanism itself is confirmed working.

Bismillah. Foundational piece both Phase 2b (Sabaq Dhor's move-to-Dhor)
and Phase 3 (Setup's baseline marking) depend on, built first on its own
rather than duplicated inside each.

**`baseline_selection` now stores quarter-unit IDs (1-120), not whole
juz' numbers**, for `baseline_mode='juz'`. A juz' is always exactly 4
quarters, and Dhor's own "Portion per session" setting already only
ever works in quarter/half/full-juz' sizes — so representing the
eligibility pool at quarter granularity (the finest of those) means a
juz' can now be *partially* eligible, e.g. just its first half, which
there was previously no way to represent at all. `shared/data.js` gained
`quarterUnitId`/`quarterUnitToJuzQuarter`/`quarterUnitsForJuz`/
`quarterUnitsForHalf` for converting between a flat unit ID and its
juz'/quarter, print-independent (the logical quarter position is the
same across mushafs; only exact ayah boundaries differ by ref, resolved
separately).

**`dhorSchedule.js`'s chunk-builder reworked** to consume this flat pool
directly — groups *consecutive* quarter-unit IDs into session-sized
chunks (1/2/4 quarter-units per session, matching the granularity
setting), respecting gaps rather than assuming a whole juz' is always
available. Verified with 5 scenarios before shipping, including a pool
with a real gap (a juz' with only its first half eligible, second half
not) — chunking correctly treats that as its own group rather than
bridging into where the missing half would be.

**Setup's Juz' grid** still shows/marks whole juz' (unchanged UI) — it
now expands each marked juz' to its 4 quarter-unit IDs on save, and
shows a juz' as checked on reopen only when all 4 are already present.
Tested the full round-trip (mark → store → reopen → still shows
correctly, including a partially-covered juz' correctly NOT showing as
checked) before finalizing. Surah mode is untouched — still stores surah
numbers directly, and `dhorSchedule.js` already refuses to generate
anything for surah-based baselines, so it can't collide with the new
quarter-unit interpretation.

Bismillah. Small, contained fix while Phase 2 gets its own proper attention.

Found a real CSS bug from the screenshot: `.detail-page input`'s general `width:100%` rule was beating `.verse-ref-ayah`'s own `width:70px` on specificity (0,1,1 vs 0,1,0), which is exactly why the ayah box was stretching to fill the row instead of staying compact. Fixed by giving it a more specific selector and shrinking it further (46px, enough for 3 digits plus the browser's own spinner), freeing that space back to the surah name. Also removed the header row's ability to wrap — Save was dropping to its own second line on narrow widths because the date field plus everything else didn't quite fit on one row; the date field is now more compact too, so all of icon/title/date/Save fit on the same first row on every card.

Bismillah. First of a new 4-phase plan replacing V3.12.0/V3.13.0's Sabaq/
Sabaq Dhor design, once it became clear a sabaq entry isn't confined to
one surah or one juz' the way that design assumed.

**`sabaq_from`/`sabaq_to`** (migration 0015) replace `surah`/`ayah_from`/
`ayah_to` entirely — a clean removal (both columns dropped, not left
deprecated-in-place, per explicit request), not just a rename: the old
trio had one surah shared by both ayah numbers, which couldn't represent
an entry spanning two different surahs at all. Each field is now a
`"surah:ayah"` string (e.g. `"114:6"`), and `sabaq_from`/`sabaq_to` can
each name a different surah. Confirmed scope: no limit on how many
surahs an entry spans, capped at crossing at most one juz' boundary
(`shared/data.js`'s new `crossesAtMostOneJuzBoundary`, which checks
adjacency in *study* order — juz' 29→1 counts as one boundary same as
29→30, even though those aren't numerically next to each other).

**UI**: each field is one combined control — a chevron opens the full
surah picker, the ayah itself is a bounded number input (browser stepper
or the numeric keypad), never rolling over into the next surah on its
own (confirmed: only the chevron changes the surah).

**Prepopulation**, replacing the old advance-by-one-ayah logic: any Dhor
history at all → neither field prepopulates; no Sabaq history yet →
114:1/114:6; otherwise the last reached point prefills *To* if currently
in juz' 30 (studied backwards) or *From* otherwise (studied forwards).
Tested directly, not just reasoned through: brand-new student → 114:1/
114:6; after logging into juz' 30's content → next open prefills To with
the frontier; after crossing into juz' 29 → next open prefills From
instead.

**Line/page calc now sums across every surah a span touches** — the
existing `getLines13/15ForAyahRange` functions still only understand one
surah each; new `getLinesForSpan` walks every surah between `sabaq_from`
and `sabaq_to` (handling juz' 30's reversed, high-to-low surah order,
not just ascending) and adds them up. Caught and fixed a real bug here
before shipping: the first version's surah loop assumed `from ≤ to`
numerically, which silently returned zero for any juz'-30-direction
span — re-verified with both directions before finalizing.

**Position tracking simplified**: `position_json` is now just
`{ sabaqTo, activeJuz }` — `sabaqTo` is the single source of truth,
`activeJuz` is derived from it after every save. The V3.12.0 behaviour
of auto-adding a completed juz' to Hifz Setup's `baseline_selection` is
REMOVED — that's superseded, now Setup's own job (a separate, later
phase). Sabaq Dhor's card (`sabaqDhorPage.js`) is untouched in this
delivery and keeps working exactly as before against this same position
shape — its own rebuild (rollable quarter/half/juz' sections) is Phase 2.

Bismillah. Second of the 3-part detail-screen delivery (V3.12.0 was
position tracking + Sabaq; this is Sabaq Dhor, which depends on that
landing first; the Dhor card's planner/timer-popup work is still ahead).

**Sabaq Dhor is now genuinely position-driven.** Confirmed definition:
it's revision of the CURRENT juz' (whichever one Sabaq is presently
learning) from that juz's start up to wherever Sabaq has actually
reached, excluding today's brand-new portion — replacing the earlier
"beginning of Quran / halfway point" rule entirely. Shown as a checklist:
the quarter Sabaq is currently partway through is one section, and each
quarter before it that's already fully covered is its own section too —
at most 3 of those, since a juz' only has 4 quarters and the 4th-
equivalent one is always the one currently in progress. Every section
comes prepopulated checked (these are derived from what's actually been
memorised); the student unchecks anything they didn't actually revise
today. Whichever stay checked get composited into one overall from/to
ayah range at save time.

**The juz' 30 direction problem, solved and tested.** Juz' 30 is studied
backwards (114→78) — its quarters, structurally numbered in the normal
ascending direction, don't line up with the order Sabaq actually walks
through them. New in `shared/data.js`: `studyQuarterIndex()` (its own
inverse — reverses for juz' 30, leaves everything else unchanged),
`structuralQuarterOf()`, and `structuralQuarterBounds()`, all built
specifically to get this right rather than assume every juz' behaves
like the other 29. Verified with real numbers before shipping: a
frontier at 90:5 with `activeJuz: 30` correctly produces a *complete*
section for 98:1-114:6 (study quarter 1) and a *current, partial*
section for 89:1-90:5 (study quarter 2) — matching the actual reversed
study order, not the structural one.

Migration 0014 adds `sabaq_dhor_log.from_surah/from_ayah/to_surah/
to_ayah`; the old free-text `zone` column stays in the table (unused
going forward) rather than being dropped.

Bismillah. First of a 3-part delivery for the detail-screen redesign
(Sabaq Dhor's checkable-quarters and the Dhor card's planner/timer-popup
work are separate, later deliveries — each depends on this one landing
first).

**Position tracking, wired in for the first time.** The `position` table
and its Worker endpoints already existed (built earlier, never called
from anywhere) — this delivery is what actually uses them. Shape:
`{ activeJuz, sabaqFrontier: {surah, ayah} | null }`. New in
`shared/data.js`: `SABAQ_STUDY_ORDER` (30 first backwards through its
surahs 114→78, then 29 forwards, then 1-28 ascending — the "1 or 28"
branch noted elsewhere picks 1 as the simpler deterministic default,
flagged rather than guessed at silently) and the position-math helpers
built on it. New `js/position.js` orchestrates it client-side, per the
Worker's own "computed client-side" design note.

**Sabaq card**, rebuilt around that position: prepopulates surah/
ayah_from from wherever Sabaq last reached (a brand-new student starts at
114:1); ayah references shown as surah:ayah numerals, never surah names;
`line_count`/`page_count` auto-compute once `ayah_to` is entered
(`getLines13ForAyahRange`/`getLines15ForAyahRange`, built in V3.9.1/
V3.9.4, sitting unused until now) and are shown editable, since the
underlying figures are estimates worth letting a student correct; on
save, position advances, and if that completes the current juz', it's
folded into Hifz Setup's `baseline_selection` automatically — confirmed
in chat, no manual Juz' grid check-off needed. Migration 0013 adds
`line_count`/`page_count` to `sabaq_log` (no inline trailing comments —
the exact bug that broke two earlier migrations).

Every position-math function was tested end to end before this shipped —
new student → 114:1; sabaqing to 114:6 → next default 113:1; finishing
all of juz' 30 → `completedJuz: 30`, next default 67:1 (start of juz' 29)
— not just reasoned through, actually run.

**All 4 detail cards** (Sabaq/Sabaq Dhor/Dhor/Tadabbur):
- Header row now holds an icon (display-only), the title, the date field
  (moved here from its own row), and an icon+label Save button — the old
  bottom-of-card Save button is gone.
- Cards capped at `max-width: 30%` on desktop (design target: a 13"
  monitor as the practical maximum, not an ultra-wide external display);
  with all 4 visible the grid already computes ~25% each on its own.
- Tajweed picker is now a compact trigger button opening a popup with a
  checkbox per tag (was an inline row of toggle buttons) — multi-select
  doesn't fit a scroll-wheel or a plain dropdown.
- The comment block's "Your comment on this session" is now "Notes",
  and its privacy checkbox is now a genuine Private/Public switch
  (default Public) — the "keep hidden from teachers" text is gone.
  Tadabbur's own privacy control gets the same switch treatment.
- Swipe dots now show text labels (Sabaq/SDhor/Dhor/Tadabbur) and sit
  above the rail, not below it as plain circles.

The switch component itself moved out of `settingsScreen.js` into a new
`js/uiSwitch.js` (loads early) so `commentPrivacy.js`/`reflectionCard.js`
could use the same one rather than duplicating it.

Bismillah. Everything from the last few rounds of feedback on V3.10.0,
plus one new feature (Tomorrow's Portion) that needed real backend work.

**Text and layout:**
- Gender moved onto the Name row itself as a small inline switch (was
  its own full-width row further down the page).
- Mushaf's 13-line and 15-line options now have explanatory hints too
  (Hybrid already had one): "13-line IndoPak/Waterval." and "15 Line
  Uthmani script."
- "Mark completed sections" → "Mark completed sections using".
- "Default targets" → "Target for Dhor", styled as a proper header
  (darker, heavier) rather than a plain field label.
- "Dhor Schedule" → "Dhor Plan", everywhere (heading text; the
  underlying section id/element ids are unchanged, this is a display
  rename only).
- `inputmode="numeric"` added to every numeric field (the 3 Dhor
  targets, portion quantity, haidh cycle length and duration) — a
  plain number pad on mobile instead of the full keyboard.

**Correction:** the Juz'/Surah switch now always springs back to
neutral once its popup closes, regardless of what was picked inside.
V3.10.0 had it slide to reflect `baselineMode` instead and stay there —
that's what's fixed here. Tapping either side still always opens its
grid no matter where the thumb currently sits.

**New: Tomorrow's Portion.** A row added after Days of week — date is
always tomorrow, the portion is the student's own choice from a
dropdown built out of their memorised (baseline) juz', broken into
individual units at whichever granularity is currently selected above
(e.g. quarters: `Q-Juz-1-1` through the last unit of the last memorised
juz'). Picking one and saving passes it straight through to
`dhorSchedule.js`'s generator as an explicit starting point for that one
generation call only — every other call (routine top-ups from the Dhor
log page, or a later Setup save with nothing picked) is untouched and
keeps the existing auto-detect-from-history behaviour, so this can
never silently reset a rotation that's already progressing.

Naming, confirmed and tested against the actual segment math before
shipping:
- 13-line/Hybrid: `Juz-N` whole, `H-Juz-N-1`/`H-Juz-N-2` halves,
  `Q-Juz-N-1`..`Q-Juz-N-4` quarters.
- 15-line: `Juz-N` whole; `Hizb-N` for halves, numbered *globally*
  across the whole Quran (1-60) rather than per-juz' — a global hizb
  number is already unambiguous on its own, unlike a 13-line "half"
  which has no name of its own to fall back on; `Rub-N-P` for quarters,
  per-juz' (this is the print's true quarter-of-a-juz' unit — the
  project's existing `RUB_BOUNDARIES.uthmani` array is actually
  Maqra-level granularity, 8/juz', not Rub'; `QUARTER_BOUNDARIES_UTHMANI`
  from V3.9.1, 4/juz', is the one that's genuinely Rub'-level, and is
  what this actually reads from).

The dropdown's list and the generator's own chunk sequence are built
from the same underlying math (`segmentRangeForUnitIndex` /
`buildChunks`'s single-unit case) so a picked label always corresponds
to exactly what the rotation would produce on its own.

Bismillah. Two things in one delivery, confirmed to go together: Hybrid
becomes a real, selectable mushaf option, and every plain either/or
control across Setup and Dhor Schedule becomes a genuine switch instead
of a button pair.

**Hybrid mushaf:** enabled in Setup (was shown-but-disabled since
V3.7.0). One rule, applied everywhere a `ref` gets derived from a
student's mushaf: page/line math always follows 15-line data for a
Hybrid account, quarter/half/juz' math always follows 13-line rules —
same as a plain 13-line account, never the 15-line print's own
rub'/hizb/juz' system. `worker/src/dhorSchedule.js` already fell through
to `waterval` for anything that wasn't `15line_madani`, so Hybrid needed
no new branch there — just enabling the value in `profile.js`'s
validation and the Setup UI.

**Dhor log page's reference dropdown is gone.** It used to be a separate
per-device `localStorage` setting, independent of the student's actual
mushaf choice — that inconsistency is why Hybrid couldn't have worked
cleanly before. Now `ref` is derived from `profile.mushaf` fresh on every
open, the same rule as above, for every student — not just Hybrid ones.

**Switch redesign**, all in Setup + Dhor Schedule:
- Gender, mushaf (3-way, with an explanatory line under it for Hybrid),
  Dhor Schedule's portion-granularity (3-way) and frequency (2-way) are
  now genuine switches — one rounded track, a sliding highlighted thumb
  — replacing the button-pair look those fields used before.
- "Mark completed sections" (Juz'/Surah) is a switch too, but with a
  neutral center: tapping either side always opens its slide-in grid
  regardless of where the thumb currently sits; the thumb only reflects
  which mode is actually set, resting muted in the middle if nothing's
  been marked yet. A plain 2-way switch doesn't fit here, since tapping
  opens a tool rather than flipping a persistent state.
- Default targets and Haidh's 3 fields are now one row each, label on
  the left, input on the right, instead of stacked. "Frequency (days)"
  is renamed "Revision cycle time (days)".
- Dhor Schedule's portion-per-session row now has the quantity number
  first (left), the granularity switch after it (right) — reversed
  from the original order.
- Days-of-week is now forced onto one line at every width (was allowed
  to wrap) — more compact per-button padding, no change to the 7-day
  multi-select behavior itself.
- Surah grid (the slide-in from "Mark completed sections") is now 3
  columns instead of 2, as a trial — easy to revert if it doesn't read
  well in practice.

The generic switch component (`renderSwitch()`/`wireSwitch()` in
`settingsScreen.js`, `.switch-track`/`.switch-option`/`.switch-thumb` in
`settings.css`) handles 2-way, 3-way, and the neutral-center variant with
the same code — none of it needed a special case per switch, just
however many slots a given track has.

Bismillah. Closes the other half of the sabaq line-count gap —
`getLines13ForAyahRange` had no 15-line counterpart until now.

`AYAH_LINE_UTHMANI` in `shared/data.js`: `[surah, ayah, page, startLine,
endLine]` for all 6236 ayahs, sourced from the Quran.com API's own
word-level `line_number` field (via the user's `Generate_Quran_Mapping.py`,
run locally since this sandbox can't reach that host). Verified before
use: page assignment matches `quranmeta.json`'s independently-sourced
page field at all 6236 ayahs — 0 mismatches. Genuinely per-page line
data too, not another disguised running index: line numbers reset per
page and cap at 15 (matching the print's name), and behave the way real
typesetting does — e.g. Al-Fatiha's ayahs 3 and 4 share one line, ayah 7
spans three.

`getLines15ForAyahRange(surah, ayahFrom, ayahTo)` reads this directly —
no word-ID lookup step needed the way the 13-line version requires,
since this data is already at the same per-ayah granularity `sabaq_log`
itself stores (surah/ayah_from/ayah_to). Handles same-page and
multi-page spans, using each page's *actual* line count
(`PAGE_MAX_LINE_UTHMANI`, derived from the data itself — page 1 only
uses 8 of its 15 lines, so a hardcoded 15-per-page assumption would have
been wrong there).

Unlike the 13-line figure, this one isn't flagged as an approximation —
the underlying per-ayah positions are the real thing.

Not done in this delivery, by design: wiring either line-count function
into any UI (sabaq entries don't display one yet — same "built, not yet
wired up" state `getLines13ForAyahRange` has been in all along).

Bismillah. `PRAGMA table_info(students)` on production showed exactly 4
of migration 0011's 7 new columns present — all 4 from the Dhor Schedule
section (`dhor_granularity`, `dhor_quantity`, `dhor_frequency`,
`dhor_days_of_week`), none from the Haidh section
(`haidh_cycle_length`, `haidh_period_length`, `haidh_next_expected`).

Honest note: this doesn't fully match the "inline trailing comment"
theory from V3.9.2 — two of the four columns that *did* apply
(`dhor_quantity`, `dhor_days_of_week`) had that exact issue too, so
something else caused execution to stop specifically before the Haidh
section, not addressed by that fix alone. Not chasing the exact
mechanism further right now — the priority is getting production
working again.

New migration 0012 adds only the 3 still-missing columns, kept
deliberately bare (no comments, plain ASCII only, nothing beyond the
3 statements) to remove any further risk. Do not re-run 0011 — the
4 columns it already added would now fail as duplicates.

Bismillah. Migration 0011 had inline trailing comments after a semicolon
on 3 lines (`dhor_quantity`, `dhor_days_of_week`, `haidh_next_expected`) —
the exact pattern that broke migration 0010's runner before (see that
entry). Same mistake, repeated, despite it already being a documented
gotcha — should have caught this before shipping V3.9.1.

If that migration didn't fully apply as a result, `profile.js`'s GET/POST
handlers would be selecting/updating columns that don't exist yet on the
live `students` table, which fails at the database level — a very likely
explanation for a 500 right after login, since `/profile` is the first
thing called post-login to route to Setup or Journal.

Every comment in the migration is now on its own line; none share a line
with a SQL statement. Re-run this corrected file against production D1,
then retest login.

Bismillah. Closes the surah-baseline gap flagged in V3.9.0, one layer at a
time — this delivery is the verified reference data itself; wiring it into
Dhor Schedule generation (to let a surah-based Hifz Setup baseline drive it,
not just a juz'-based one) is a natural next step, not done here.

**Resolved this session, all in `shared/data.js`:**
- `JUZ_BOUNDARIES` — confirmed to be the 13-line print's own boundaries
  specifically, not a print-independent average as the code previously
  (incorrectly) commented.
- `JUZ_BOUNDARIES_UTHMANI` (new) — the 15-line Madani print's own 30 juz'
  boundaries, derived from `RUB_BOUNDARIES.uthmani`'s every-8th marker.
  Verified against all 30 — differs from the 13-line boundaries at exactly
  one point, juz' 4 (13-line: 3:92, 15-line: 3:93).
- `getJuzForPosition`/`juzStartSurah`/`getJuzSurahSpan` are now ref-aware
  (optional `ref` param, defaulting to 13-line for existing callers).
- `HALF_BOUNDARIES.waterval`/`.uthmani` and `QUARTER_BOUNDARIES_UTHMANI`
  (new) — half- and quarter-juz' boundaries for both prints (13-line
  quarters are `RUB_BOUNDARIES.waterval` itself, already fine-grained
  enough; no separate array needed there). The 15-line print's own eighth-
  of-juz' breakdown is `RUB_BOUNDARIES.uthmani` as-is.
- `SURAH_JUZ_RANGE`/`getSurahJuzRange()` (new) — which juz' each surah
  touches. Verified identical for both prints across all 114 surahs (the
  one ayah-level difference doesn't change which surahs touch which juz'),
  so one shared table covers both.
- Corrected a stale code comment that had claimed `RUB_BOUNDARIES.waterval`
  diverges from `JUZ_BOUNDARIES` at 6 points "due to a real print
  variation" — re-verified properly (the original check didn't handle
  surah rollover) and it's 5 points (juz' 7,14,20,21,23), and since both
  are confirmed 13-line, it looks like residual imprecision in that source
  rather than a genuine print difference. Flagged in the comment, not
  silently corrected — there's no more-authoritative source to fix it
  against.

**Caught in my own review before this shipped**: my first pass at writing
the derived arrays into the file had transcription errors (wrong lengths on
3 of them). Re-derived everything programmatically from the source data and
cross-checked lengths and internal consistency (e.g. every 2nd quarter-
boundary entry must equal the corresponding half-boundary entry) before
finalizing — worth knowing this class of mistake is possible, and worth the
same check on any future hand-edit of these tables.

Bismillah. The Setup screen is no longer 2 swipeable cards — it's one
continuous page with 4 independently-saved sections: Profile, Hifz Setup
(both carried over, reshaped), and two entirely new ones, Dhor Schedule and
Haidh. Neither gets its own nav item: both live permanently inside Setup,
reachable via "Settings" at any time, not just during onboarding. The old
"Plans" nav placeholder is gone entirely as a result.

**Profile / Hifz Setup, reshaped:**
- Gender is now two exclusive toggle buttons (matching the mushaf/
  granularity pickers' look) instead of a `<select>` — same M/F values
  underneath, no backend change.
- "Mark completed sections" (the old Surahs/Juz' baseline picker) is now
  two buttons — Juz' and Surah — that each open a full slide-in grid
  overlay (30 cells / 114 cells, scrollable) instead of one inline area
  that swapped content on a mode toggle. Still mutually exclusive:
  confirming a selection in one clears the other. The overlay's close icon
  commits the selection into the section's pending state, same as any
  other field here — it does not save to the server by itself; the Hifz
  Setup section's own Save button still does that, so this doesn't behave
  differently from every other field on the page.
- Default targets (mistakes/minutes/frequency per juz') are unchanged.

**Dhor Schedule (new):** a settings form, no visible table — students pick
a portion size (Juz'/Half/Quarter, plus how many per session), a frequency
(Daily/Twice a day), and which days of the week. Saving drives a rolling
7-day plan generated behind the scenes (`worker/src/dhorSchedule.js`,
called on-demand — Setup save, and whenever the Dhor log page opens — never
a background job). Plan rows land in the existing `plans` table
(`plan_type='dhor'`), which already had full CRUD and completion-linking
built (V2/V3 schema) — nothing new needed there.

Generation walks the student's memorised juz' pool (from Hifz Setup's
`baseline_mode`/`baseline_selection`) in plain ascending order, never
letting one session's segment span across a gap between non-adjacent
memorised juz' (the normal early-stage pattern — e.g. juz' 30, 29, 1
memorised but not 2-28 yet). It anchors to whichever is further along in
that sequence — the last actually-logged `dhor_log` entry, or the last
existing plan row — so logged reality overrides a stale unfulfilled plan,
while an already-generated future plan never gets silently reassigned a
different portion on a later call.

Haidh interaction (confirmed in chat): no dhor is generated on a haidh or
predicted-haidh day — that date is skipped and the window extends outward
to make up the session, rather than losing it. Days not in the chosen
weekday set are just normal off days, not made up.

**Scope note, flagged rather than silently approximated**: generation
currently requires `baseline_mode = 'juz'` (a surah-based baseline isn't
mapped to juz' coverage yet — that needs real ayah-boundary math, a
separate piece of work) and uses plain ascending juz' order, not the
branching "30, then 29, then 1-or-28, then the rest" study order noted
elsewhere for initial memorisation — that branching depends on a
per-student choice this project doesn't store anywhere yet. Both cases
return a clear reason rather than generating something wrong.

**Haidh (new):** also a settings form, no visible calendar — cycle length,
duration, and next expected haidh day. Shown only when gender is F, live
off the gender picker (not just on reload). This reuses the existing
`/attendance/predict` endpoint (`worker/src/attendance.js`, unchanged,
live since migration 0001) entirely as-is — the `attendance` table already
has `predicted-haidh` as a status, and predictions already never overwrite
real data. The only genuinely new work is the Setup UI itself, plus one
small reconciliation: Setup asks for "next expected day" (the more
intuitive input), and the frontend computes that endpoint's own `lastStart`
param from it (`lastStart = next_expected − cycle_length`) — so the backend
needed no changes for this at all.

**Dhor log page and journal quick-add now use plans, not just link them:**
- `dhorPage.js` fetches today's Dhor plan(s) on open. Zero: unchanged manual
  picker. One: every field pre-fills from it, and saving links back to it
  (existing `plan_id` handling in `logHelpers.js`, unchanged). More than
  one: a plain selector, never auto-picked.
- The journal's quick-add cells previously showed a "planned" indicator and
  passed `plan_id` through on save, but never pre-filled the form's actual
  values — tapping one still opened a blank form. Now fixed for `sabaq` and
  `dhor` (whose plan fields map directly onto their quick-add fields).
  `sabaq_dhor` is not pre-filled: its plan rows store `surah`/`ayah_from`/
  `ayah_to` (matching `sabaq`), but the log itself needs a computed `zone`
  string that isn't wired into the frontend yet (same gap already flagged
  in `sabaqDhorPage.js`) — left manual rather than guessed at.

**Also (small, root-cause fix):** the Dhor segment/granularity math
(`segmentsPerJuz`/`unitMarkerCount`) used to be a `dhorPage.js`-local copy.
Moved to `shared/data.js` (already dual-loaded by frontend and Worker) since
`dhorSchedule.js` needs the exact same math server-side — two copies is
exactly what `CONVENTIONS.md` principle 2 exists to prevent.

Bismillah. Corrects the remaining iPhone-specific gap in V3.8.1: a newly
installed Home Screen app now opens the student's personal `/<uniqueID>` URL
on its very first launch, so the PIN-only screen appears without requiring a
one-time ID entry inside the standalone app.

**Why V3.8.1 was incomplete on iPhone**: iOS Home Screen web apps have cookies
and storage separate from Safari. The ID saved while using the personal page
in Safari therefore was not available inside a newly-created standalone app.
Worse, the shared manifest's `start_url: "/"` explicitly discarded the
personal path during installation, leaving the new app with no possible way
to know which student it belonged to. The fallback screen in the reported
screenshot was therefore the expected result of those two platform rules.

**Apple-mobile installation path**: new `js/pwaManifest.js` detects iPhone,
iPad, iPod, and iPadOS desktop-mode user agents. On those devices it omits the
shared Web App Manifest link, allowing Add to Home Screen to save the exact
current page URL. The existing Apple standalone meta tags and touch icon stay
in place, so the installed experience remains full-screen and branded. Every
other platform still receives `manifest.json`, preserving the normal Chrome/
Android PWA installation route.

**Defence in depth retained**: V3.8.1's remembered-ID behavior remains. It is
still useful after a fallback login, for existing installations, and on
platforms whose installed app shares origin storage. PINs are never stored and
the authentication token remains session-only.

**Required once for existing iPhone installations**: the old Home Screen icon
has already saved `/` as its launch target. Page code cannot rewrite that
installed shortcut. Delete that icon, open the personal `/<uniqueID>` URL in
Safari, and use **Add to Home Screen** again after V3.8.2 is deployed. Future
launches from the replacement icon start on the PIN-only personal screen.

No Worker, D1 schema, or migration changes are needed.

## V3.8.1 — home-screen PIN-only return login (2026-07-28)

Bismillah. Installed home-screen launches now remember which journal belongs
to that device, so a returning student enters only their PIN rather than the
unique ID and PIN every time.

**Root cause corrected**: the manifest always launched the installed PWA at
`/index.html`, while the personalized login could only obtain an ID from a
`/<uniqueID>` path. That made every home-screen launch fall through to the
generic ID+PIN screen even after a successful login.

**Remembered device identity**: a successful login now saves only the unique
ID in `localStorage` (`hh_login_id`). The PIN is never stored, and the auth
token remains in `sessionStorage`, so closing the app still requires a fresh
PIN. Opening a personal `/<uniqueID>` link takes priority over the remembered
ID and does not replace it unless that new account successfully logs in.
An already-open authenticated V3.8.0 session is upgraded too: its verified
profile ID is remembered as soon as the new frontend loads.

**Routing and account safety**: `/` and `/index.html` are both treated as
neutral launch paths, covering new installs and already-installed icons that
may retain the old URL. After a remembered-ID lookup succeeds the address is
canonicalized back to the personal URL. `bootApp()` uses the same effective-ID
rule, preserving the V3.4.2 cross-account guard without treating `index.html`
as if it were a student ID. The PIN/create-PIN screens now include **Use
another ID**, which forgets the device association and returns to the generic
sign-in screen; ordinary Log out intentionally keeps the remembered ID.

**Manifest**: `start_url` is now `/`, with an explicit `/` scope. No Worker,
D1 schema, or migration changes are needed.

## V3.8.0 — top-paint fix generalized + Hifz Setup (2026-07-27)

Bismillah. Two pieces: a permanent fix for the "invisible until scroll"
bug (queued as a finding, now actioned), and the full Hifz Setup card
(history baseline + default targets), turning the Setup screen into 2
cards.

**Top-paint fix, generalized**: `fixJournalTopPaint()` — hardcoded to only
ever correct `#screen-journal` — is now `fixScreenTopPaint(screenId)`,
called unconditionally at the end of `showScreen()` for whichever screen
is actually showing (including the "not built yet" placeholder). This is
why Setup had the identical symptom: the original fix simply never ran
for any screen besides journal. No future new screen can reintroduce this
gap now, since nothing needs to remember to wire it in again.

**Setup restructured into 2 cards**, matching the unified day-log view's
grid/rail pattern (V3.6.1) — row/grid on larger screens, swipeable rail
on mobile, dot indicators, Sky (`#D0DBE7`) background on both:
- **Profile** — the existing view-only header + journal name + gender,
  unchanged in content, just its own card now, with its own save icon.
- **Hifz Setup** — mushaf (existing picker, moved here from Profile) →
  history (pick Surahs or Juz' — exclusive choice, switching discards the
  other's selection; the matching grid slides in; multiple items ARE
  selectable within whichever mode is active) → default targets
  (mistakes/juz', minutes/juz', frequency in days — pre-filled with 2/40/30).
  Its own independent save icon, separate from Profile's.

**Backend**: migration 0010 adds `baseline_mode`, `baseline_selection`
(JSON array, stored as text), `target_mistakes_per_juz`,
`target_minutes_per_juz`, `target_frequency_days` to `students`.
`profile.js` extended accordingly, with validation on each new field.
Deliberately NOT integrated with `position_json`'s `activeJuz`/`studyOrder`
yet — the baseline is a one-time self-reported fact, not derived progress
state, and that deeper integration is real follow-up work for whenever the
rings feature (which also reads `position`) actually gets built.

**Deliberately unchanged**: saving either card sets `setup_complete`, so
completing just one card is enough to stop being routed back to Setup —
neither card is required to unlock the other.

## V3.7.1 — Setup screen: sizing fix + save icon (2026-07-27)

Bismillah. Both findings documented against V3.7.0, now actioned.

**Desktop container width**: `--width-desktop` (tokens.css) bumped 25% →
30%. Separately, `#screen-settings` never actually had the width-cap rule
that `.login-card`/`#screen-admin` already carry — it's a single-container
form, same category as those two, and should have had this from the start.
Added the same `max-width: var(--width-tablet)` (768–1179px) /
`max-width: var(--width-desktop)` (≥1180px) rule, mirroring their exact
pattern. Both pieces were needed together — the token bump alone wouldn't
have fixed the reported stretching, since the screen was never wired into
the system in the first place.

**Save icon**: the Setup screen's bottom-of-form text "Save" button moved
to an icon-only button on the right of the header row, next to the "Setup"
title — icon-over-button preference (already on file, reiterated for this
screen specifically). New `save` icon added to `icons.js`, converted from
the uploaded `save.svg` to match this file's existing format; stroke-width
normalized to `1.8` to match most of the current set (the source file used
`1`), same normalization already applied to `home.svg` in the same round
of uploads.

**Explicitly out of scope for this delivery**: the broader icons-folder
migration (item 5 from the nav/icon restructuring discussion) — still a
separate, not-yet-fully-scoped delivery (`close.svg`'s intended use is
still unconfirmed, among other things). This delivery only actions the

## V3.7.0 — Setup screen: profile section (2026-07-27)

Bismillah. First piece of the bigger 4-area onboarding design discussed in
chat (profile, history+targets, Dhor planning, haidh tracking) — deliberately
scoped to JUST the profile section this delivery, kept separate from the
other 3 so a broad change doesn't land in the same delivery as a big new
feature (the exact mistake behind the V3.6/V3.6.2 incident).

**New Setup screen** (`screen-settings`), reached two ways: the existing
"Settings" nav item (was a placeholder until now), and automatically on a
new user's first login, before `setup_complete` is set — `bootApp()` in
`app.js` now checks `profile.setup_complete` instead of always going
straight to the journal.

**View-only header**: name, Unique ID, URL (with the existing copy-button
pattern reused from the create-PIN/registered screens).

**Editable**: journal name (a custom title for the journal, not the
student's real name — new `journal_name` column), gender (already existed
as a field, just never had setup-screen UI), and mushaf choice — all 3
options shown (13 line / 15 line Madani / Hybrid), Hybrid rendered
disabled/unselectable since it isn't built yet (new `mushaf` column,
constrained to the 2 real values; the server rejects `hybrid` as a value
for the same reason the UI doesn't offer it).

**Backend**: migration 0009 adds `journal_name` and `mushaf` to `students`.
`profile.js`'s existing GET/POST (already handled name/gender/track_haidh/
setup_complete from the V1.4-era work) extended to include both.

**Deliberately NOT in this delivery**: history capture, default targets,
Dhor planning, haidh tracking, and the icons-folder/nav-label
restructuring — all separate, later work.

## V3.6.2 — cache policy reversed: nothing cached, anywhere (2026-07-26)

Bismillah. V3.6 paired the `?v=` versioning with `_headers` set to
`immutable, max-age=31536000` for `css/js/shared` — the standard pattern
production build tools use, safe specifically because their deploys are
atomic (a new version string can't appear before every file behind it has
landed). This project's deploys are manual, file-by-file uploads with no
such guarantee, and that gap was hit directly: a browser loaded
`app.js?v=3.6.1` mid-deploy, before the full V3.6.1 file set had actually
landed, got the old code back, and cached it *immutably* — meaning no
later deploy under that same version string could ever fix it for that
browser. `reflectionCard.js`'s 404 during the same window got cached the
same way.

**Reversed, not tuned:** rather than picking a shorter-but-still-nonzero
cache duration, `_headers` now sets `Cache-Control: no-store` for
everything, project-wide — no caching at all, anywhere, by any browser or
intermediate cache. For a project at this stage (active development,
changing minute to minute, no atomic deploy step, and no real user traffic
yet where cache-hit-rate would matter), there's essentially nothing to
gain from caching and a full year of blast radius to lose if this gap
gets hit again. `CONVENTIONS.md` #10 updated with the full reasoning for
future reference, including when it might be worth reintroducing (atomic
deploys, or real production traffic).

**What stays:** the `?v=` query-string versioning on every CSS/JS
reference — it isn't what caused this, and it's still what breaks a cache
that forms somewhere outside this project's control (a stray proxy, a CDN
that ignores `_headers`), plus what any future reintroduced caching would
key off.

**Version bump**: `?v=3.6.1` → `?v=3.6.2` across every reference in
`index.html`, and `sw.js`'s `ASSETS`/`CACHE_NAME` to match — this is what
actually clears the currently-stuck bad cache, since `no-store` alone
doesn't undo a cache entry that already exists under the old URL.

## V3.6.1 — unified day-log view (2026-07-26)

Bismillah. Replaces the 3 separate Sabaq / Sabaq Dhor / Dhor screens with
one screen holding all 4 cards (Sabaq, Sabaq Dhor, Dhor, and a new
Tadabbur/reflection card) — all 3 journal column headers now open this
same screen, starting on whichever card matches the header clicked.

**Layout**: large/desktop screens show all 4 cards as a static 1×4 grid,
no scrolling. Tablet shows a swipeable rail, 2 cards in view. Mobile shows
a swipeable rail, 1 card in view. Dot indicators track position on the
rail (hidden on the desktop grid, where there's nothing to indicate a
position within). Each card is independently vertically scrollable, so
its fields + Recent history fit without growing the card unboundedly.

**Recent history**: each of the 3 log cards' existing "Recent" swipe rail
(past entries of that type) moved to the bottom of its own card — same
feature as before, just relocated.

**Independent per-card date selectors**: Sabaq, Sabaq Dhor, and Dhor each
get their own `<input type="date">`, defaulting to today every time the
screen opens. Changing one card's date only changes which date THAT
card's next save uses — the other 3 cards stay on whatever date they're
each individually set to. This is genuinely new: every save previously
hardcoded `date: todayISO()`, so there was no way to log a missed day at
all before this. Note this only affects what date a NEW entry saves
under — it does not load an existing entry for editing (multiple entries
per day are deliberately allowed app-wide, see SCHEMA.md, so there's no
single "the" entry for a date to load).

**Tadabbur card, new**: the `reflections` table and `apiReflections` API
client already existed with no frontend — this is the first UI for it.
Deliberately different from the other 3 cards: reflections are meant to be
ONE per day, so this card loads today's existing reflection (if any) on
open and updates it in place on save, rather than always creating a new
row. No date selector, no Recent rail on this card, per spec.

**Two latent bugs fixed, exposed by mounting cards simultaneously**: both
`tajweed.js`'s "+ add" button and `commentPrivacy.js`'s comment
textarea/checkbox used fixed, non-unique ids (`tajweedAddBtn`,
`cb_comment`, `cb_private`). This was invisible while only one detail page
was ever mounted at a time, but the unified view mounts all 3 log cards'
pickers/comment blocks at once — `document.getElementById` always
resolves to the FIRST matching id in the document, so the 2nd/3rd card's
"+ add"/comment controls would have silently wired themselves to the 1st
card's elements instead. Both now scope their lookups to their own
container via `querySelector`, documented as new `CONVENTIONS.md`
principle #11.

**Files changed:**
```
index.html
js/app.js
js/tajweed.js
js/commentPrivacy.js
js/sabaqPage.js
js/sabaqDhorPage.js
js/dhorPage.js
css/detail-pages.css
sw.js
CONVENTIONS.md
```
**New files:**
```
js/reflectionCard.js
js/logDetailScreen.js
```

**Version bump**: every CSS/JS reference in `index.html` moved from
`?v=3.6.0` to `?v=3.6.1` (per the `CONVENTIONS.md` #10 discipline from
V3.6) since multiple files changed; `sw.js`'s `ASSETS` list and
`CACHE_NAME` updated to match — still not registered, no behavior change
there.

**Retest before merging to `main`**: `TESTING.md` §16. The per-card date
selectors and the container-scoping fixes both specifically need testing
with all 3 log cards open together (not one at a time), since that's
exactly the condition that was previously untested.

---

## V3.6 — real cache-busting (2026-07-26)

Bismillah. Closes the gap identified while debugging a medium/large-screen
rendering report: `sw.js`'s `CACHE_NAME` bump on every release only ever
evicted the *service worker's* own cache — it never touched the browser's
ordinary HTTP cache or Cloudflare's edge cache, both of which will keep
serving an old file under an unchanged URL indefinitely.

**Version-string query params**: every local `<link rel="stylesheet">` and
`<script src="...">` in `index.html` now carries `?v=3.6.0`
(`css/tokens.css?v=3.6.0`, `js/app.js?v=3.6.0`, etc.) — `sw.js`'s own
`ASSETS` list updated to match, so it stays correct for whenever it's
actually registered (Level 2, still not done, no behavior change here).
New convention documented in `CONVENTIONS.md` #10: bump this version string
across every reference, together, whenever any CSS/JS file changes — this
is manual discipline, there's no build step generating it.

**New `_headers` file** (Cloudflare Pages convention, didn't exist before):
`css/`, `js/`, and `shared/` get `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000,
immutable` — safe now that their URLs change whenever their content does.
`appicons/` gets a more moderate week-long cache (not query-string
versioned). `index.html`, `manifest.json`, and `sw.js` are explicitly set to
`no-cache, must-revalidate` — these are the entry points that reference
everything else, so they must always be fetched fresh or the browser never
learns a new version string exists in the first place.

**Files changed:**
```
index.html
sw.js
CONVENTIONS.md
```
**New file:**
```
_headers
```

**Retest before merging to `main`**: `TESTING.md` §15. This needs an actual
deployed preview (Cloudflare Pages) to verify — `_headers` has no effect
served from a plain local file open in a browser.

---

## V3.5 — PWA Level 1: installability (2026-07-26)

Bismillah. Scoped deliberately to core Web App Manifest + responsive web +
HTTPS + Android/Apple install conventions — stopping short of registering
the service worker or any offline behavior (that's Level 2, separate future
work).

**Manifest icon paths, actually fixed**: `manifest.json` declared
`icon-192.png` and `icon-512.png` at the repo root — neither file has ever
existed anywhere in this repo, so Chrome's install criteria (which require
a valid 192px and 512px icon) were failing silently. Now points at the real
files in `appicons/`.

**New maskable icon**: `appicons/maskable-icon-512x512.png`, added as a new
`purpose: "maskable"` manifest entry. The existing badge artwork
(`android-chrome-512x512.png`) fills its canvas edge-to-edge with no safe
margin, so reusing it directly would get clipped by Android's adaptive-icon
mask. The new asset instead places the transparent logo mark
(`appicons/logo.png`) on a `--palette-sage` (#829672) background, scaled so
the mark's bounding-box corners sit ~188px from center — comfortably inside
the ~205px safe-zone radius (80% of the 512px canvas).

**Apple Home Screen conventions**: `index.html`'s `<head>` gained
`apple-touch-icon` (the file already existed in `appicons/`, it just wasn't
referenced anywhere), `apple-mobile-web-app-capable`,
`apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style` (set to `black-translucent`, so the
status bar blends with the Sage banner once launched standalone), and
`apple-mobile-web-app-title`.

**Favicon links**: `favicon.ico`, `favicon-16x16.png`, `favicon-32x32.png`
also already existed in `appicons/` but were never linked from `<head>` —
fixed, so the browser tab icon now actually shows.

**Cleanup**: removed `appicons/site.webmanifest` — an orphaned,
auto-generated manifest never linked from `index.html`, with blank `name`
fields and icon paths pointing at the domain root rather than `appicons/`.
Kept for reference only until now; safe to delete since nothing referenced
it.

**Deliberately unchanged**: `sw.js` — it still exists but is not registered
anywhere. Registering it (plus any actual offline caching behavior) is
Level 2, not part of this delivery.

**Files changed:**
```
manifest.json
index.html
```
**New asset:**
```
appicons/maskable-icon-512x512.png
```
**Removed:**
```
appicons/site.webmanifest
```

**Retest before merging to `main`**: `TESTING.md` §14 — this is a
device/browser-only check, no backend involved. Needs a real Android Chrome
device/desktop Chrome and a real iOS Safari device to confirm properly;
DevTools can confirm the manifest itself is valid but not the actual
install/home-screen behavior.

## V3.4.3 — duplicate-flow correctness, inactive-student search, styling fixes (2026-07-26)

Bismillah. Eleven items from a second round of testing on V3.4.2, built together.

**Duplicate-check correctness**: the Continue button on both registration paths now makes a single `force:true` call and reacts to the match info THAT call returns, instead of trusting a flag stored from the original match — the real bug this fixes: editing the WhatsApp number to a genuinely different value and then pressing Continue was still asking "mark existing journal inactive?" even though the edited value no longer collided with anything. The duplicate search itself now also searches inactive students, not just active ones — previously a match against a retired journal went undetected entirely. Since self-registration has no direct admin actions, matching an inactive journal now offers a "request reactivation" email instead of the (now-inapplicable) "deactivate" question. The admin duplicate-match hint text now echoes back the actual matched name, WhatsApp number, and active/inactive status, rather than a generic message — useful now that the admin list can have several similarly-named test entries. Deactivating any student (via the admin toggle or either duplicate-flow's deactivate action) now automatically resets their PIN too, so a later reactivation always starts fresh.

**Styling/layout fixes**: the tablet/desktop breakpoint moves from 900px to 1300px — a real iPad 2 in landscape (1024px CSS width) was landing in the desktop 25%-width bucket instead of the intended tablet 50%-width bucket (known remaining edge case: a 12.9" iPad Pro in landscape, at 1366px, still lands in desktop under this threshold). The admin registration box's label/input regained the `display:block`/full-width styling every other form already has — it only looked right before because a since-removed wrapping `<div>` was accidentally forcing the line break. `.form-hint` (used for the actual explanatory text — the duplicate-match message, the registration-confirmation message) now reads off `--font-size-base` like labels/errors/buttons already do; it was wrongly left at 11px in V3.4.2. The journal table's weekday abbreviation (Sat/Sun) is a little bigger; the "+ add" placeholder text was confirmed already correct and untouched.

**Safari fix, root cause this time**: the "journal hidden under the banner" report turned out to not be a notch/safe-area issue at all — live inspection on an actual iPhone showed the DOM fully populated with real data and no console errors, but nothing painted until the page was scrolled. This is a known WebKit compositing bug: a `position: sticky` flex sibling (`#authBand`) before a `flex: 1` sibling (`#appContent`) computes layout correctly but doesn't paint it until a reflow forces it. Fixed by promoting `#appContent` onto its own compositing layer via `transform: translateZ(0)`. The safe-area-inset fix already shipped in V3.4.2 stays in place — it addresses genuine notch clearance, a separate concern from this paint bug.

**Correction (same day)**: the `translateZ(0)` attempt above did NOT actually fix it — retested on the same iPhone, still invisible until scroll. Likely cause: `#appContent` was never the element being shown/hidden (it always exists) — `#appShell` is what actually flips from `display:none` to `display:flex` at login, so promoting a child of the thing that changes may simply not touch whatever Safari fails to repaint at that transition. Replaced with a JS-driven fix in `app.js` (`fixJournalTopPaint()`): after the journal renders, it measures the real gap between the auth band's bottom edge and the journal content's actual position, and only corrects it if one exists — deliberately not a blind fixed-height margin, since that would double up with the already-correct flex layout once actually painted and leave a permanent visible gap on every device. The act of reading+writing those layout values is what forces Safari through a synchronous layout+paint pass, which is what actually resolves the symptom — the position correction itself is more of a safety net than the real mechanism. The `transform: translateZ(0)` line stays on `#appContent` (harmless, just not sufficient alone). Same pass also made the journal table's column headers sticky (`position: sticky`, offset via a JS-measured `--auth-band-height` custom property rather than a guessed static value, since the band's real height varies with the safe-area inset).

**Second correction (same day)**: the sticky-headers-inside-the-table approach above visually ended up covering the first data row once actually tested. Restructured: the header row now lives in its own container (`.journal-header-row`), a sibling of `.journal-wrap` rather than a `<thead>` inside `.journal-table` — this is what's actually sticky now, positioned via the same `--auth-band-height` variable. Column alignment between the header and the rows below (now two separate elements instead of one table's automatic layout) is kept in sync via an explicit `<colgroup>` on the table matched to identical `nth-child` percentages on the header row. The "Journal" `<h2>` heading was removed, and both the header row and the rows container now bleed to the screen edges (negative margins canceling `#appContent`'s own padding, down to a 4px residual) rather than sitting inset — `journal.js` itself needed no changes, since it only ever touched `#journalTbody`.

**Auth dropdown menu**: "Sign out" renamed to "Log out," moved to the end of the menu (after Refresh), and its icon (only the icon, not the label) is now red to set it apart as the one different-in-kind action in that list.

**Branding**: a new `appicons/logo.png` (added to the repo directly) now appears above the existing content on the personalized login, fallback login, registration, and create-PIN screens — centered, capped near 400px wide but scales down responsively so it can't overflow a narrow phone's card.

worker/src/auth.js
worker/src/admin.js
```

**New asset expected in the repo (not part of this zip)**: `appicons/logo.png` — the user has already added this directly; this delivery only references it.

**Retest before merging to `main`**: `TESTING.md` §13 has the full checklist, including the D1-only tests for inactive-student matching and the auto-reset-on-deactivate rule, plus a manual pass confirming the Continue-button fix (edit the WhatsApp to something new, then Continue, and confirm no deactivate prompt appears).

## V3.4.2 — session hardening, duplicate-check gap, typography/responsive protocol (2026-07-26)

Bismillah. Fourteen items from a round of V3.4.1 testing, built together.

**Session/back-guard, refined**: the back-guard now takes two presses instead of one — the first shows "Press back again to log out" (not silent), the second actually logs out. Separately, `bootApp()` now verifies the loaded profile's own ID actually matches the unique ID in the URL, closing a real gap: editing the ID directly in the address bar and pressing enter is a fresh page load, not a back/forward history traversal, so the back-guard's `popstate` listener never saw it and a stale token kept showing whichever account it belonged to regardless of the URL. Both fixes are separate and complementary — one covers history navigation, one covers direct navigation.

**Duplicate-check gap closed**: the name+WhatsApp check only ever ran when a WhatsApp number was actually given — leave it blank and two same-named students went completely undetected. A shared `findDuplicateMatch()` helper (used by both self- and admin-registration) now falls back to a name-only check against active students when WhatsApp is absent.

**Duplicate-match UI restructured, both registration paths**: the form fields now stay visible and editable throughout — no more hiding the inputs behind a separate prompt. Three buttons on a match: **Cancel** (dismiss, form stays as typed), **Continue** (always resubmits with whatever's *currently* in the fields — if unedited, creates the duplicate with an auto-appended number; if edited to no longer collide, becomes an ordinary registration), **Reset PIN** (unchanged, always targets whichever student was matched when the prompt first appeared, regardless of later edits). Admin's "also deactivate?" confirm, and the reset-PIN confirm, now read "CANCEL: Both journals remain active ; OK: mark existing journal INACTIVE" instead of the native dialog's generic Cancel/OK with no context.

**Admin panel**: "optional" removed from both WhatsApp placeholders (registration form and the user-detail card) — the field itself is still optional, just not labeled as such.

**Typography**: new `--font-size-base: 14px` root variable (tokens.css) — body text, form labels, error/result messages, and both button classes now read off it, so a future size change cascades from one place instead of being hunted down across files. Fine-print elements (`.eyebrow`, `.form-hint`, monospace IDs, nav tile labels) stay deliberately smaller by design.

**Responsive width protocol, refined**: replaces the old ~1/3 (33%) cap with exact breakpoints — mobile fills the available width, tablet is 50% (two fit side by side), desktop is 25% (four fit side by side), all centered. Applied to `.login-card` (every login/register/create-PIN/registered screen shares it) and `#screen-admin`. The percentage values live in shared `--width-tablet`/`--width-desktop` tokens; the breakpoints themselves (600px/900px) are necessarily repeated as literals since media queries can't consume CSS custom properties in their condition.

**Fallback screen**: "New Registration" moved from inline with the "Sign in" heading down to the bottom of the card, below the "Forgot your pin or ID?" text.

**Create-PIN screen**: now shows the full registration-confirmation message plus the personal URL and a copy icon (as a reminder — reuses the same message and a new shared `wireCopyButton()` helper, not a duplicate of the "Registered!" screen's Continue button). The "Confirm PIN" row stays hidden until "New PIN" is fully entered, and re-hides if the two don't match.

**Safari fix**: `#authBand` now adds `env(safe-area-inset-top)` on top of its normal padding — confirmed Safari-only (Android was unaffected), consistent with `viewport-fit=cover` letting content render under the notch/status bar without it.

**Files changed:**

js/auth.js
js/adminPage.js
sw.js
worker/src/auth.js
worker/src/admin.js
```

**Retest before merging to `main`**: `TESTING.md` §12 has the full checklist — the two-press back-guard timing, the URL-edit-while-logged-in case, the no-WhatsApp duplicate case for both registration paths, and a visual pass on a real Safari/iOS device for the safe-area fix specifically (nothing else in this delivery can be verified from a desktop browser alone).

## V3.4.1 — session security, duplicate-registration handling, admin list polish (2026-07-25)

Bismillah. Five items queued up across several rounds of testing/discussion
on V3.4, built together.

**Session security**: the login token moved from `localStorage` to
`sessionStorage` — it's cleared automatically the moment the tab/app
actually closes, so reopening always requires signing in again, given the
journal contents is considered valuable enough to be worth that tradeoff.
Alongside it, a back/forward guard: right after a successful login, one
extra history entry is pushed, so pressing back (or forward) while
authenticated always logs out and drops back to a fresh login screen
instead of silently continuing whatever session happens to still be
active — this is what directly stops one account's session from carrying
over onto a different account's URL via the browser's own back/forward
buttons. It only interrupts an authenticated session; it never traps
anyone or blocks navigation outright.

**Admin registration gets a WhatsApp field** — previously name-only even
though the backend already stored WhatsApp; the admin panel's register
form now collects it too.

**Duplicate-registration handling, for both self- and admin-registration**:
a matching name+WhatsApp against an existing *active* student surfaces a
warning, never a block. Self-registration keeps "Create a new journal
anyway" / "Reset PIN for the existing journal" (email); admin gets
"Continue" / "Reset PIN" (a direct action — no email needed, admin already
has that capability). Both flows now also offer marking the old/matched
journal inactive when continuing anyway — self-registration routes that
through email too (the "match" is just a self-reported claim, not verified
identity), admin gets a direct action. When continuing past a match, the
new record's name gets an auto-appended disambiguating number ("John
Smith" → "John Smith 2", then "John Smith 3", ...) via a shared
`nextDisambiguatedName()` helper used by both registration paths.

**Admin student list**: each row now has copy and native-share icon
buttons for that student's personal URL (share is feature-detected and
simply hidden on browsers without `navigator.share`, e.g. desktop Firefox
— no fallback, it just isn't there). Inactive students' names are greyed
out instead of a separate "Active"/"Inactive" text label, which is
removed — keeps rows more compact. Row markup changed from one big
`<button>` to a clickable name/ID button plus sibling icon-buttons,
since a `<button>` can't legally contain another `<button>`.

**Registration-confirmation screen**: the "Continue" button is now "Copy
and Continue" — it copies the personal URL to clipboard and then
navigates, so pressing the big button without using the copy icon first
doesn't leave anyone without their URL. The standalone copy icon is
unchanged.

**Files changed:**
```
js/api.js
js/app.js
js/auth.js
js/adminPage.js
js/icons.js
index.html
css/admin.css
sw.js

worker/src/admin.js
```

**Retest before merging to `main`**: the manual walkthrough in
`TESTING.md` §11, plus the D1-only duplicate-check/auto-numbering tests
for both registration paths.

---

## V3.4 — URL-based personalized login + registration duplicate-check (2026-07-25)

Bismillah. A login-flow rework built around one idea: a student's personal
URL is the "lock" for their journal (kept private, never memorized), and
their PIN is the "key" — not reasonable to expect a student to remember a
random ID as well as a PIN.

**Registration**: WhatsApp label/placeholder cleaned up ("WhatsApp number",
hint placeholder `+CODE 123456789`); before creating an account, a matching
NAME+WHATSAPP combination against an existing *active* student (normalized —
trimmed/case-insensitive name, digits-only WhatsApp, so formatting
differences don't hide a real match) now offers a choice instead of silently
creating a possible duplicate: "Create a new journal anyway" or "Reset PIN
for the existing journal" (opens a pre-filled `mailto:`). On success, auto-
navigates to a new "Registered!" screen showing the exact confirmed
onboarding message plus the student's personal URL as copyable text next to
a copy icon-button.

**URL-based login** (new `GET /auth/lookup?id=` endpoint, public, returns
just `{name, hasPin}` for an active ID — 404 for anything else, deliberately
vague like the login endpoint): visiting `/<uniqueID>` now skips the ID
field entirely and greets the student by name ("Ahlan wa Sahlan, [name]"),
either on a plain PIN-entry sign-in (PIN already set) or a new create-PIN
screen (first login — PIN entered twice to confirm). Every PIN entry point
across all three login screens now auto-submits on the 4th digit — no
Sign-in button anywhere.

**Fallback screen kept** for anyone reaching the app with no unique ID in
the URL, an ID that doesn't exist, or one that exists but isn't active —
same ID+PIN screen, with the "4-digit PIN"/"First time..." text and Sign-in
button removed, "New here? Register" → "New Registration", and its lost-
access message changed to "Forgot your pin or ID?" (the personalized
screens keep the original "Lost pin" wording — deliberately different
messages for the two contexts).

**Bug fix, not just a copy change**: the "content hidden behind the auth
banner" report traced to `#welcomeBanner` — `position: fixed` with a higher
z-index than `#authBand`, firing on *every* boot (not just first login), so
it covered the band and page content for 3 seconds on every load. Moved into
normal document flow inside `#appShell`, right after the auth band, so it
pushes content down instead of overlapping it.

**Also**: `sw.js`'s cache-name bumped and its precache list completed (it
was missing `detail-pages.css`, `admin.css`, and six page-specific JS files
that already existed — found while touching this file, unrelated to the
banner bug itself, which private-browsing testing had already ruled out as
a caching issue).

**Deferred, on purpose**: the Sabaq/Sabaq Dhor/Dhor detail-page container
width, the "Recent" rail sizing, and the three commentPrivacy.js tweaks —
holding until history and mushaf/model selection are sorted out first.

**New file needed on the Cloudflare Pages side**: `_redirects` (repo root)
— `/* /index.html 200` — so any path (`/<uniqueID>`) serves `index.html`
instead of a 404; the frontend then reads the path itself.

**Fix applied before merge**: the first pass of this delivery had a real
bug, not a config issue — screen switching used inline `style.display`,
but every login screen except the fallback carries a `hidden` class whose
CSS rule is `display: none !important`, which silently wins over an inline
style. Result: the fallback screen (no `hidden` class) rendered by default
and then hid itself once the URL lookup resolved, but nothing else could
ever show — a brief flash of the wrong screen, then blank. Fixed by
toggling the `hidden` class consistently everywhere instead (and giving
the fallback screen the same class as the others, so nothing shows until
JS explicitly picks one).

**Second fix, same delivery**: on the create-PIN screen, `clearPinGroup()`
was being called on the create row and then the confirm row right after —
since it always focuses the first box of whichever group it's called on,
the second call's focus silently won, so both the initial screen load and
a PIN-mismatch retry left the cursor in the confirm row instead of the
create row. Fixed by clearing confirm first, create last, in all three
places this happens (initial load, mismatch retry, and the server-error
retry after a successful match).

**Files changed:**
```
index.html
css/base.css
css/components.css
js/icons.js
js/api.js
js/auth.js
js/app.js
sw.js
worker/src/auth.js
worker/src/index.js
_redirects (new)
```

**Retest before merging to `main`**: the manual browser walkthrough in
`TESTING.md` §10, plus a private/incognito pass on the personalized and
create-PIN screens specifically, since the fallback/personalized split
depends on `/auth/lookup` behaving correctly for all three of "no ID",
"unknown ID", and "inactive ID".

## Reconciliation — repo had drifted significantly behind (2026-07-25)

Bismillah. Triggered by a question about whether the `frontend/` folder
move had actually happened — checking the real uploaded repo directly
(rather than continuing to assume) revealed the gap was much larger than
that one question: **9 files missing entirely, 11 present but stale
(predating V3.3.3/V3.3.4), 1 stray duplicate migration file** sitting at
the repo root outside `worker/`.

**Missing entirely**: `css/detail-pages.css`, `manifest.json`, migration
`0008_whatsapp_number.sql`, and six JS files that `index.html` actively
references — `commentPrivacy.js`, `dhorPage.js`, `sabaqDhorPage.js`,
`sabaqPage.js`, `tajweed.js`, `timer.js`. Their absence meant the Sabaq/
Sabaq Dhor/Dhor detail pages and the PWA manifest were genuinely broken
on the live site, not just out of date.

**Stale (present, but predating recent work)**: `admin.js`, `auth.js`,
`index.js`, `utils.js` (worker), `adminPage.js`, `api.js`, `auth.js`,
`icons.js`, `index.html`, `components.css`, `shared/data.js` (frontend).

**Confirmed NOT a gap, despite showing up in the raw comparison**:
`worker/src/entries.js`'s absence is correct — it was deliberately
deleted back in V2.2; the file only appeared "missing" because my own
scratch working copy had never been cleaned of it either.

**Fix delivered**: one complete package (45 real files) rather than
another incremental delta, given a delta-based approach is what let this
gap accumulate unnoticed in the first place — every current frontend
file, every worker source file, every migration, all syntax-checked
before delivery (26 JS files, all passing).

**Still needed on the user's end**: delete the stray root-level
`migrations/0007_admin_role.sql`, and run migration 0008 against
production (it was never applied — the file itself never made it into
the repo before now). Migration 0007 itself is unaffected by any of this
— confirmed already applied and working (verified earlier via a real
`ABCDEFG` login returning `role: admin`).

**Process note, worth carrying forward**: this happened at least in part
because recent deliveries (V3.3.2's follow-on patches, V3.3.3, V3.3.4)
weren't consistently making it fully into the live repo, and there was
no periodic check to catch that until a folder-structure question
prompted one. Worth periodically diffing the actual repo against the
working state, not just assuming each delivery landed cleanly.

## V3.3.4 — self-registration frontend + Lucide icons (2026-07-25)

Bismillah. The actual public registration screen, plus two more findings
that naturally belonged on the same login screen while it was already
being touched.

**Registration screen**: name + optional WhatsApp number, reachable via
a "New here? Register" link from the sign-in screen. On success, shows
the new ID clearly and pre-fills it into the login screen's ID field —
one less thing to copy by hand before setting a PIN.

**First-login "save this URL" message** — a real gap closed, not just
documented: `firstLogin` came back from the login API from the very
start of this project, but nothing in the frontend ever did anything
with it. Now, the first time anyone logs in (fresh registration or an
admin-created account), a one-time message appears encouraging them to
save the page or add it to their home screen — since there's no other
account-recovery path if that's the only place they ever log in from.

**Lost-PIN mailto link** — also previously only documented, not built.
A plain `mailto:hifzhelper.app@gmail.com` link on the sign-in screen,
pre-filled with a "Lost PIN" subject line. Zero backend, zero cost, per
the earlier decision.

**Lucide icon set** — `sabaq`/`sabaqDhor`/`dhor` now use Lucide's
`ellipsis`/`grip-horizontal`/`grip` icons (already correctly built with
`currentColor` and a `24x24` viewBox, matching every other icon in the
set) — **verified directly**: confirmed exact circle counts per icon (3/
6/9) and that all three correctly use `currentColor` + the standard
viewBox, not just eyeballed against the source files.

**Files changed:**
```
frontend/js/icons.js
frontend/js/auth.js
frontend/js/api.js (apiRegister — added in V3.3.3, now actually used)
frontend/css/components.css
frontend/index.html

## V3.3.3 — self-registration backend + carried-forward findings (2026-07-25)

Bismillah. Backend for self-registration, plus the two items explicitly
carried forward to this version.

**`POST /auth/register`** (public, no token) — creates a student account
(self-registration always creates students only, never teacher/admin —
that stays an admin-only action). `name` required, `whatsapp_number`
optional (its purpose is disambiguating similarly-named students, not
identity verification, so nothing enforces it). No PIN set — same
first-login flow as every other account.

**ID generation consolidated to one place** (`utils.js`) — it was
duplicated in `admin.js` before this; now both admin-created and
self-registered students generate IDs through the same function
(CONVENTIONS.md principle 2).

**`whatsapp_number` column added** (migration 0008) — admin-created
students can now optionally get one too, and `POST /admin/update-user`
can edit it on any existing student, alongside the carried-forward
**editable active status** (a checkbox now, not read-only text) — both
using the same partial-update pattern as everything else, verified
directly: tested the field-diffing logic against realistic scenarios
(nothing changed, only WhatsApp changed, cleared, toggled inactive),
including the null-vs-empty-string edge case for a student who never
had a number set.

**Hamburger icon** replaces the down-chevron on the auth banner's
dropdown toggle — the other carried-forward item.

**Deliberately not in this pass**: the actual public self-registration
*screen* — that's V3.3.4, kept separate per the established backend-
first sequencing. The API client function (`apiRegister`) is ready and
tested, just not called from any UI yet.

## V3.3.2.4 — prep for moving index.html to the deployment root (2026-07-25)

Not deployed yet — this is ready for whenever the folder move actually
happens on your end. Confirmed approach: the **whole** `frontend/`
folder's contents move to the repo root (no `frontend/` folder at all),
not `index.html` alone — this keeps every existing `css/`/`js/` reference
inside `index.html` working unchanged, since they all move together
maintaining the same relative relationship. The only thing that actually
needed fixing: the `shared/data.js` reference, since `shared/` stays
where it is and becomes a sibling of the new root instead of the old
`frontend/` folder.

**Two files needed the fix, not one** — `index.html`'s script tag, and
`sw.js`'s own cached-asset list had the identical stale `../shared/data.js`
reference. Cache version bumped too, so browsers don't keep serving the
old cached files after the structure changes.

**Checked and confirmed unaffected**: `manifest.json`'s `start_url:
"./index.html"` needs no change — it's relative to `manifest.json`
itself, and the two move together. Also noted in passing: `sw.js` isn't
actually registered anywhere in the current code (no
`navigator.serviceWorker.register()` call exists) — a separate, real
finding, not part of this fix.

**Files changed:**
```
frontend/index.html
frontend/sw.js
```

**When you're ready to actually do the move**: upload these two (already-
fixed) versions to the new root location, alongside moving `css/`, `js/`,
and `manifest.json` there too.

---

## V3.3.2.3 — conventions + admin findings batch (2026-07-25)

Bismillah. `CONVENTIONS.md` extended first, then the buildable findings
from the last several rounds of testing.

**`CONVENTIONS.md`**: three new numbered principles, each grounded in a
real bug found this session, not hypothetical — environment values living
in one config spot (the stale `API_BASE` bug), never rendering UI against
async state before it's actually arrived (the missing-Admin-tile boot
order bug), and every component owning its own responsive behavior at
*both* ends of the screen-size spectrum, not just mobile (the register
button overflow + the desktop over-stretch, same underlying discipline,
opposite symptoms). File structure section also brought up to date —
it had drifted significantly behind the actual repo.

**Admin: delete a user** (`DELETE /admin/users`) — deliberately does
**not** cascade-delete history. D1's own foreign key enforcement (which
we hit directly during the 0007 migration) does the real work here: a
student with any existing records in `attendance`/`position`/any log
table fails to delete with a clear, deliberate error, rather than
silently destroying their history. Only a genuinely empty account can be
removed this way.

**Admin: edit name** (`POST /admin/update-user`) — same partial-update
shape as the log tables' `PATCH` endpoints. WhatsApp editing is not in
this pass — that column doesn't exist yet (arrives with V3.3.3).

**Student list redesign**: compact searchable list (ID / Name / Status)
replacing the old 5-column table — selecting a row opens a detail card
with everything editable (name, role, reset PIN, delete). This resolves
the mobile-overflow finding for the student list specifically by making
the list itself simple enough to never need to overflow.

**Both mobile-layout bugs actually fixed, not just documented**:
- Register button: explicit `width: auto` override where it sits inside
  a flex row — the exact fix CONVENTIONS.md principle 9 now documents
- Admin screen container: capped at 720px on screens ≥900px wide,
  rather than stretching to fill an ultra-wide monitor

**4-digit PIN as separate boxes**: auto-advances as each fills, backspace
on an empty box returns focus to the previous one — **tested directly**,
not just written: simulated typing through all four boxes, confirmed
correct advancing and that non-digit characters are filtered without
advancing focus.

**"Welcome, [Name]"**: a brief banner shown once each time the app boots
successfully (fresh login or returning with a valid token) — implemented
as a lightweight greeting rather than a full separate screen+navigation
step, a deliberate simplification worth knowing about.

**Deliberately not in this pass**: WhatsApp number editing (blocked on
the column not existing until V3.3.3); the URL restructuring
(`index.html` to the deployment root, `/UniqueID` path) — a genuinely
different kind of change (deployment/routing structure, not application
code) that deserves its own dedicated pass rather than being folded in
here.

## V3.3.2.2 — hotfix: Admin tile missing from dropdown (2026-07-25)

`bootApp()` rendered the dropdown nav (`setupAuthBandAndDropdown()`)
*before* fetching the profile that sets `currentUser.role` — so the
dropdown always rendered against the default `role: 'student'`, no
matter who was actually logged in. Reordered: profile fetch now happens
first, dropdown renders after. Home page tiles were never affected —
they render on-demand when navigated to, by which point the role is
already correctly known.

**Verified directly**, not just reasoned about: simulated both the old
and new ordering — old order reproduces exactly 8 items with no Admin
tile (matching the reported screenshot precisely), new order correctly
shows 9 including Admin.

**Files changed:**
```
frontend/js/app.js
```

---

## V3.3.2.1 — hotfix: frontend pointed at the wrong Worker (2026-07-25)

`frontend/js/api.js`'s `API_BASE` was still the old dev Worker URL, left
over from V3.1 — from before the decision to work directly on production
and delete the dev repo. Every account created since then (including
`ABCDEFG`) only exists in production's database, so login was failing
correctly, just against the wrong target. Updated to the production
Worker URL.

**Files changed:**
```
frontend/js/api.js
```

---

## V3.3.2 — admin frontend (2026-07-25)

The user-list screen — reset PIN, change role, and register a new student,
all three together as agreed, since they share the same screen.

**Nav gating, tested not just asserted**: the "Admin" tile only appears for
`role === 'admin'` — verified directly (not just by inspection) that
students and teachers both get exactly 8 nav items with no admin tile,
while an admin gets 9. The backend already 403s non-admins on every
`/admin/*` endpoint regardless — this is purely about not showing a
button that would only ever fail for everyone else.

**Reset PIN and change-role both confirm before acting** — a plain
`confirm()` dialog, since both are real, immediate account-affecting
actions (reset PIN locks someone out until they set a new one; role
change is a genuine permission escalation if going to teacher/admin).
Declining a role-change reverts the dropdown back to its actual current
value rather than leaving it visually wrong.

**Register-student** shows the newly-generated ID clearly on screen after
creation, since that's the one piece of information the admin actually
needs to hand to the real student.

**Files changed/added:**
```
frontend/css/admin.css   (new)
frontend/js/adminPage.js (new)
frontend/js/icons.js
frontend/js/auth.js

```

**Still ahead**: V3.3.3/3.3.4 — self-registration (backend then frontend).

---

## V3.3.1 — admin backend (2026-07-25)

Bismillah. First piece of a genuine account-management system, replacing
the "teacher inserts a row via the D1 console" habit we've been using for
every test student this whole project — consistent with the explicit
"no manual database changes" principle going forward.

**Schema**: `role`'s `CHECK` constraint only allowed `student`/`teacher` —
rebuilt the table (same pattern as migration 0003, since SQLite can't
alter a `CHECK` constraint in place) to allow `admin` too. Seeded one
bootstrap account in the migration itself — `ABCDEFG` / `ADMIN-01`,
**no `pin_hash` set**, so it goes through the exact same first-login flow
every other account uses (whatever PIN gets typed in first becomes the
real one) — nothing pre-hashed, since the pepper needed for that isn't
available at migration-write time by design.

**Four new endpoints, all gated to `role === 'admin'`** (`worker/src/admin.js`):
- `GET /admin/users` — list every student, never returns `pin_hash`
- `POST /admin/reset-pin` — clears a student's PIN, same recovery mechanic
- `POST /admin/change-role` — student/teacher/admin
- `POST /admin/register-student` — creates a new student with an
  app-generated unique ID (6-char, same format as existing IDs),
  collision-checked against the real database rather than assumed unique
  — **tested**: generated 1000 sample IDs, confirmed correct format and
  zero collisions among them, consistent with the ~2.18 billion possible
  IDs in that space

**Deliberately not in this pass**: the admin frontend (V3.3.2), self-
registration (V3.3.3/4) — this is backend only, same "backend first,
frontend as its own pass" sequencing as everything else.

**Files changed:**
```

## V3.2 — dedicated per-log-type pages (2026-07-24)

The three pages reached via the journal table's column headers — replacing
their "not built yet" placeholders from V3.1. Written fresh, shared logic
factored out rather than repeated three times.

**New shared components** (used across all three pages):
- `tajweed.js` — the tag picker, extendable, major/minor aware.
  `TAJWEED_DEFAULTS` (`shared/data.js`) restructured from a flat string
  list into `{tag, major}` objects — added the three major categories
  agreed in design (Substitution, Omission, Addition), kept the existing
  eight as minor. Custom tags a student adds default to minor.
- `commentPrivacy.js` — the student-comment block with its private
  toggle, plus a read-only teacher-feedback display when present.
- `timer.js` — the real start/lap/stop timer.
  **Tested the actual invariant before shipping**: sum of lap times must
  exactly equal total duration. Verified with a simulated multi-lap
  sequence (15s total, three laps summing to exactly 15) before wiring it
  into the UI. A session with no explicit lap tap sends a plain
  `duration_seconds` with `lap_times: null` — never a trivial one-element
  array — per "make inputs optional wherever possible."

**Dhor page** (the richest of the three): reference selector, a juz'+
position+amount (quarter/half/full-juz') picker that computes
`segment_from`/`segment_to` correctly for whichever reference is active —
**tested this conversion directly**: waterval quarter/half/full = 1/2/4
markers, uthmani = 2/4/8, and confirmed real juz'-boundary examples
compute the right marker ranges, not just the unit counts in isolation.
Plus the timer, tajweed picker, mistakes, and comment block.

**Sabaq and Sabaq Dhor pages**: same shared components, their own fields.
**Known, flagged gap**: Sabaq Dhor's `zone` field is meant to be computed
automatically from the student's position/study-order data — that
computation isn't wired into the V3 frontend yet (nothing fetches
`position.json` anywhere in this codebase so far), so it's a manual text
field for now rather than a faked computation.

**All three pages** also show a swipe rail of recent entries (the last 14
days), reusing the swipe-rail CSS pattern from V3.1.

**Deliberately still not in this pass:**
- The gamified three-ring visual map — still the single biggest remaining
  piece
- Plans aren't wired into these pages yet — no plan-prepopulation, no way
  to create a plan, and no `plan_id` gets sent even though the Worker
  already supports it
- The three-model selector (13-line/Madina/Hybrid) — Dhor's reference
  picker here is the old simple two-option version, not the full model
  system
- Editing an existing entry from the recent-entries rail (currently
  read-only — tapping a rail card doesn't do anything yet)
- Privacy enforcement is visible (the toggle exists and saves) but
  nothing yet reads it back differently for a teacher view, since no
  teacher-facing screen exists

## V3.1 — frontend foundation (2026-07-24)

Bismillah. The first piece of the frontend rebuild against the V2/V3
backend — written fresh (new modular file structure), not adapted from
the old V1.x monolithic `app.js`/`api.js`/`styles.css`, per preference.

**What's actually built and tested this round:**
- **CSS token layer** (`css/tokens.css`) — the five-color palette and the
  three ring colors defined once as named variables with documented
  usage, exactly as instructed, so either can be changed in one place
  later rather than hunted through component files.
- **Journal landing table** (`css/journal-table.css`, `js/journal.js`) —
  the physical-planner-style table (Date | Sabaq | Sabaq Dhor | Dhor |
  Feedback), Sage header for Date, Mauve for the log columns, matching
  the actual paper journal. Pulls from the real `/sabaq`, `/sabaq-dhor`,
  `/dhor`, `/reflections`, `/plans` endpoints — genuinely wired to V2/V3,
  not a mockup.
- **Auth band + slide-down dropdown** (`css/nav.css`, `js/auth.js`) —
  icon+label nav, no background/border, per the styling instruction;
  dropdown adds logout/refresh on top of the same nav set Home uses.
- **Home page** (`js/home.js`) — icon tiles, same nav set as the dropdown.
- **Quick-add modal** — tapping a journal cell opens a simple form and
  saves a real log entry. Deliberately basic (no tajweed tags, timer, or
  flexible units yet) — enough to make the app genuinely usable for daily
  logging while the richer per-type pages are still ahead.
- **Multi-entry-per-day and plan-prepopulation both verified working** —
  tested the actual data-grouping logic (not just eyeballed): two Sabaq
  entries on the same day correctly bucket together under V2's uncapped
  model; a future-dated plan correctly creates a visible row for a day
  with no logs yet, confirming the "plan pre-populates the table row"
  mechanism actually works end to end at the data layer.
- `sw.js` updated to the new file list, cache version bumped so browsers
  don't keep serving the old cached assets.

**Deliberately NOT in this pass — the next pieces of work, not oversights:**
- The gamified three-ring visual map (frequency/mistakes/time, triadic
  colors) — the biggest remaining piece
- The Dhor timer/lap UI
- The dedicated per-log-type pages (reached via the table's column
  headers) — currently show an honest "not built yet" placeholder
- The three-model selector (13-line/Madina/Hybrid) in the UI — the
  underlying `data.js` logic exists (V2.0), not yet surfaced
- Privacy toggles (student_comment_private, teacher_feedback_visibility,
  reflections.is_private) in any input form
- Swipe rails (multiple entries per day currently just show a count
  badge, not a browsable rail)
- The V1.4 setup wizard has NOT been reconciled against the V2/V3 schema
  — everyone currently lands straight on the journal regardless of
  `setup_complete`; flagged directly in `app.js`, not silently skipped

**Please delete these from the repo — fully superseded, nothing imports them:**

## V3.0 — plans, timer/lap, privacy (2026-07-24)

Bismillah. Three features designed over several sessions, built together
in one migration since they touch overlapping tables.

**Plans** (`plans`, new table): an intention, not a record — a student can
plan a specific Dhor/Sabaq/Sabaq Dhor for a specific future date, then
complete it later either via a quick checkbox (no log created) or with
full detail (creates the real log entry, linked back via
`completed_log_id`). **The Dhor input screen's default view is now driven
by this** — a day with a plan shows it pre-filled to complete; a day
without falls back to the existing manual picker; multiple plans for one
day show a selection rather than guessing which one's intended.

**Timer/lap** (`dhor_log`): `minutes` renamed to `duration_seconds` (real
precision, not whole minutes — a lap feature needs it), plus a new
`lap_times` JSON array column holding true per-section durations. Same
"variable-length list as one column" pattern as `tajweed_tags`, deliberately
not flat `time1`/`time2` columns (the exact anti-pattern rejected earlier
when discussing reviews) and not a separate table (laps are always
created as one batch, never independently queried).

**Privacy**: `student_comment` (the student's own performance
self-assessment — distinct from `teacher_feedback`) gets a
`student_comment_private` flag; `reflections` gets the equivalent
`is_private`. `teacher_feedback` gets a three-tier
`teacher_feedback_visibility` (`all`/`teachers_only`/`private`), since
multiple teachers viewing one student is confirmed real, not
hypothetical. Enforced in `logHelpers.js`'s new `applyPrivacy()` — a
private field gets redacted at read time based on who's actually asking,
never a full row hidden. **Tested, not just written**: verified all three
viewer perspectives (the student, the authoring teacher, a different
teacher) against a realistic set of rows before shipping — every case
matched the intended rule.

**Files changed:**
```
worker/migrations/0006_plans_timer_privacy.sql   (new)
worker/src/plans.js                               (new)

worker/src/sabaqLog.js
worker/src/sabaqDhorLog.js
worker/src/dhorLog.js
worker/src/reflections.js
worker/src/index.js
SCHEMA.md
```

**Still ahead**: the frontend — nothing calls `/plans` or the new
privacy/timer fields yet. Same sequencing as every other big change this
project: backend first, frontend as its own pass.

---

## V2.3 — real edit capability, not just comments (2026-07-22)

**Correction to V2.2's design**, not a bug fix — V2.2 only let `PATCH`
touch comment fields, on the reasoning that every save should be a
permanent, unedited record. Pushed back on directly: a user correcting a
mistake doesn't care whether that's implemented as "edit the row" or
"delete and re-log it" — same practical effect either way — and the app
can't enforce honesty about whether an edit reflects what actually
happened regardless of which mechanism exists. That's on the user, not
something to design around.

**What changed**: `PATCH` on all four logs (`/sabaq`, `/sabaq-dhor`,
`/dhor`, `/reflections`) now accepts any subset of that table's own
content fields *and/or* the comment fields, updating only what's
provided — one general-purpose partial update instead of a
comment-only one. `logHelpers.js`'s `updateComment` became the more
general `updateLog`.

**Still true from V2.2, unaffected by this**: saving is still always a
new row (no per-day cap, no upsert-by-date) — this correction is about
editing an *existing* row after the fact, not about how new entries get
created.

**Frontend responsibility, not built yet**: a confirmation before
submitting a content edit, since it overwrites what's there. Not
enforced server-side — that's a UX concern for whoever's about to
overwrite data, not a rule the API imposes.

**Files changed:**
```
worker/src/logHelpers.js
worker/src/sabaqLog.js
worker/src/sabaqDhorLog.js
worker/src/dhorLog.js
worker/src/reflections.js
worker/src/index.js
```

---

## V2.2 — Worker code for the four independent logs (2026-07-22)

The Worker code to actually use the V2.1 schema — written fresh, not
adapted from the old `entries.js`, per preference. A shared
`logHelpers.js` implements the CRUD/duplicate-detection logic once (all
four tables share the same student_id/date/entered_by/comment/
is_duplicate/created_at shape), so each of `sabaqLog.js`, `sabaqDhorLog.js`,
`dhorLog.js`, `reflections.js` stays a thin wrapper supplying just its own
fields and validation.

**Real behavior change from V1.x, worth knowing**: V2 has no per-day cap,
so saving is *always* a new row now, never an upsert. Deleting is by the
row's own `id` (a real primary key), not by `date` + `entry_number` the
way V1.3 worked — there's no more "editing today's entry," each save is
its own permanent record.

**New**: comment/feedback are no longer part of the same save as the
entry's content — a separate `PATCH` (`/sabaq`, `/sabaq-dhor`, `/dhor`,
body `{id, student_comment}` or `{id, teacher_feedback}`) adds or updates
just that field, since a comment can come from a different person, later
(reflections has no comment concept, so no `PATCH` there).

**Duplicate handling**: implemented as designed — allowed, not rejected,
just flagged (`is_duplicate = 1` on the new row) when it exactly matches
an existing row's content for that student/date.

**Attendance**: all three activity logs (sabaq, sabaq dhor, dhor) mark
present on save, per the original rule — reflections do not, since
tadabbur isn't one of the three activity logs that rule covers.

**Files changed:**
```

worker/src/reflections.js  (new)
worker/src/index.js
worker/src/utils.js
```

**Delete this file, it's no longer used and nothing imports it:**
```
worker/src/entries.js
```

**Still ahead**: the frontend rebuild (independent views per log, the
three-model selector) — this Worker code has no UI calling it yet.

---

## V2.1 — independent logs schema (2026-07-22)

The actual schema rebuild designed across the long V2 planning session:
the single `entries` table is replaced with four independent logs —
`sabaq_log`, `sabaq_dhor_log`, `dhor_log`, `reflections` — no caps, each
tracking `entered_by` separately from `student_id`, each comment/feedback
field carrying its own author and timestamp. `students`/`attendance`/
`position` are untouched.

No data migration from the old `entries` table — nothing real exists in
it yet, per the "delete everything, start fresh" decision made earlier.

**Files changed:**
```
worker/migrations/0005_v2_independent_logs.sql   (new)
SCHEMA.md
```

**Still ahead**: the Worker code (new modules for the four logs, written
fresh rather than adapted from the old `entries.js`, per preference) and
the frontend rebuild (independent views per log, the three-model
selector). This migration alone doesn't make anything work yet — the old
`worker/src/entries.js` still references a table this migration just
dropped, so **do not deploy this migration without also deploying new
Worker code in the same step** — same code/schema-mismatch risk flagged
back in V1.3, same fix: merge and migrate together, not with a gap
between them.

---

## V2.0 — 13-line (IndoPak) line/page data (2026-07-22)

First entry in the V2.x line — the six-table independent-logs redesign
(sabaq_log/sabaq_dhor_log/dhor_log/reflections, the three-model reference
selector, the setup-page rebuild) is designed but not yet built; this
version starts the new numbering with the first concrete piece of it: real
line/page counting for the 13-line print, closing a gap that took most of
a full session to properly source and verify (two rejected reconstruction
attempts before finding data that actually held up).

**What's new**: `shared/data.js` gains `AYAH_WORD_RANGE` (all 6236 ayahs'
word-ID ranges, universal across print layouts) and `LINE13_RANGES`
(10769 real content lines for the 13-line print), plus
`getLines13ForAyahRange(surah, ayahFrom, ayahTo)` — returns line/page
counts for a given ayah range. Verified 114/114 against the print's own
surah markers; noted as approximate (not exact-reference-grade like the
15-line data) given a ~4% discrepancy rate found when cross-checked at
finer granularity.

**Naming correction, going forward**: stop saying "Waterval" — too
localised a name. Say "13-line (IndoPak)" instead. The internal code key
(`RUB_BOUNDARIES.waterval`) is left as-is for now rather than a piecemeal
rename — it'll be properly renamed as part of the upcoming three-model
selector rebuild (Model 1 / Model 2 / Model 3), which touches this same
code anyway.

**Files changed:**
```
shared/data.js

## V1.4 — self-onboarding setup page (2026-07-20)

New students now walk through a one-time setup screen on first login,
instead of starting from a completely blank journal. Decided against
importing historical data from old systems (a real example — Umme's dhor
log CSV — surfaced the design question, but the answer was: students
self-enter where they're starting from, the app builds forward from there).

**Setup collects**: name, gender (stored directly, may drive future
styling), haidh-tracking preference (shown only for females, independent
toggle — not auto-enabled by gender), Quran print preference (reuses the
existing device-level toggle), current sabaq position, and which juz' are
already complete (reuses the existing manzil strip, in a tap-to-mark-
complete mode). Last-dhor dates are optional — enter them if known,
otherwise a segment is simply treated as never-revised, no fabricated
history.

**Reused rather than rebuilt**: `POST /position` already accepted exactly
the shape setup needs — no new endpoint for the juz'/dhor part. The
position-update logic itself was extracted into a shared
`applyReachedPosition()` function (used by both the daily save handler and
setup), and `renderJuzStripInto()` was parameterized to accept a tap
handler, so setup's "mark complete" mode doesn't trigger a live API call
per tap the way the daily journal's does.

**New**: `GET /profile` / `POST /profile` endpoints; `gender`,
`track_haidh`, `setup_complete` columns on `students`.

**Known shortcut, not a polish gap to ignore forever**: last-dhor date
entry during setup uses a plain browser `prompt()`, not a custom date
picker — deliberate simplicity for a one-time screen, worth revisiting if
it turns out to feel rough in practice.

## V1.3 — up to two entries per day (2026-07-19)

Students can now log a second sabaq/sabaq dhor/dhor on the same day
(capped at two). Design: `entries` gets an `entry_number` column (1 or 2),
uniqueness changes from `(student_id, date)` to `(student_id, date,
entry_number)`. Frontend shows a normal form for the first entry; once it
exists, an "Add a second sabaq today" button appears; once both exist, a
small Entry 1 / Entry 2 switcher replaces it.

**Two real bugs fixed along the way, not just the new feature:**
- The delete-entry handler (both Worker and frontend) previously matched
  only on `date` — meaning deleting one entry would have deleted *both* of
  a day's entries once this feature existed. Fixed to match on
  `(date, entry_number)`.
- The frontend's local attendance optimistic-update still had the old
  "unless already haidh" exception from before the V1.1 fix — the server
  was corrected months ago but this client-side mirror wasn't. Now matches:
  sabaq always wins, unconditionally.

**Files changed:**
```
worker/migrations/0003_two_entries_per_day.sql   (new)
worker/src/entries.js
worker/src/utils.js
frontend/api.js
frontend/app.js
frontend/index.html
frontend/styles.css
SCHEMA.md
TESTING.md
```

**Migration note**: 0003 rebuilds the `entries` table (SQLite can't ALTER a
UNIQUE constraint in place) — existing rows are preserved with
`entry_number = 1`. Run it on dev first, verify via `TESTING.md` §2, then
production, same as every migration so far.

## V1.2 — new-account secret bug, resolved (2026-07-19)

**Bug (new account only, not a code defect)**: after migrating to the new
`hifzhelper-app` Cloudflare account, `hifzhelper-api-dev` returned a `500`
on every login attempt — `DataError: Imported HMAC key length (0)...`. Root
cause: `HH_AUTH_SECRET` had been saved with an empty value during initial
setup (the dashboard showed it as configured either way, since it never
displays the actual value back). Fixed by deleting and re-adding the secret
with a genuine random value. Confirmed fixed by direct evidence — added a
temporary `/debug/env` route reporting the secret's type/length (never its
value) to get real ground truth instead of continuing to infer from side
effects; removed again once resolved.

**Production was unaffected** — tested cleanly on first attempt, confirming
it was set up correctly from the start; this was a dev-environment-only
mistake.

**Files changed:**
```
worker/src/index.js
```
(temporary debug route added, then fully removed in the same version — net
effect on this file is zero, but noting it here since two separate patches
were shipped and reverted during the diagnosis)

**Lesson for future setup**: a "Value encrypted" / secret-looks-configured
display in the dashboard does not confirm the value is non-empty. Worth a
quick `/debug/env`-style sanity check (or just an immediate login test)
right after setting secrets on any new environment, rather than assuming
success from the save confirmation alone.

## V1.1.1 — new Cloudflare account/repo migration (2026-07-19)

Moved Hifzhelper to its own dedicated repo and Cloudflare account
(previously shared with other projects). No code logic changed — only
the backend URLs the frontend points at, since the new account has a
different Workers subdomain.

**Files changed:**
```
frontend/api.js
TESTING.md
```

**New URLs** (replacing the old `*.maktab4life.workers.dev` ones):
- Dev: `https://hifzhelper-api-dev.hifzhelper-app.workers.dev`
- Production: `https://hifzhelper-api.hifzhelper-app.workers.dev`

**Still needed on the new account before this is testable** (see SETUP.md):
migrations run against both new D1 databases, secrets set on both new
Worker projects, Git integration connected for both, a fresh test student
inserted into the new dev database. None of this carries over automatically
just because the repo/code is identical.

---

## V1.1 — attendance rule correction (2026-07-19)

**Bug fix**: attendance was built with a "haidh takes precedence over a
logged entry" exception that was never actually part of the agreed rule —
it was my own assumption layered on top of "any recorded activity marks
present." The real rule is simpler: **sabaq always wins**. Logging an
entry now unconditionally marks that day present, including overriding a
day previously marked haidh manually.

**Files changed:**
```
worker/src/entries.js
SCHEMA.md
TESTING.md
```

**Retest before merging to `main`**: re-run the "Manual override" row in
`TESTING.md` §3 — mark a date `haidh`, then save an entry for that same
date, then confirm via D1 console it now shows `present`, not `haidh`.

---

## V1.0 — baseline (2026-07-19)

The first fully working version: student journal PWA (localStorage removed,
now backed by a real Cloudflare Worker + D1), login/PIN auth with lockout,
entries/attendance/position all persisted server-side and verified working
end-to-end against the dev environment (login, repeat-login, wrong-PIN,
5-attempt lockout, entry save/read, attendance auto-marking — all tested via
Hoppscotch against `hifzhelper-api-dev`).

See `TESTING.md` for the repeatable version of that same test sequence —
worth re-running it against any future version before considering it done.

**Everything in this delivery** (full repo, since this is the baseline):
```

```

**Known gaps, carried forward (not bugs, just not done yet):**
- Custom tajweed tags stay local-only (no server field for them yet)
- No offline write queue — a failed save just shows an error, no retry
- Production Worker/database never tested end-to-end (only dev)
- CSS not yet split into modules (requested for next revision)
- Teacher/Maktab view (Phase 2) not started
- Mistake-marking on a page image (Phase 3) not started
